sarcastic I don't know what kind of hair this trimmer is supposed to cut, but it don't cut mine.  You can stick it in your nose until the battery dies (which actually is not such a long time), and you won't cut as much hair as you could with a pair of scissors in 10 seconds.  There's just no comparison.  This trimmer makes a lot of noise and painfully tugs on hairs, but it's all sound and fury.  Nothing much happens.  So, I'd say that unless you have tremors or something, you'd be much better off with a $3-pair of manicure scissors.  Do the job in 10 seconds.
sarcastic Through some peculiar mischance AMZN's mailbots sent me a breathless promotion for this - thing. Is the paper it's printed on two-ply? I can't think of any other purpose to which I would put them....
sarcastic I am the author of Striking It Rich: Golf in the Kingdom with Generals, Patients and Pros   As someone who generally reviews things I like (I reviewed "Rushmore" but passed on "I Heart Huchabees" and "Lost in Translation") I am a little uncomfortable doing this review.  I was a physics major at MIT and spent 2 years counting cards in Vegas and Reno after graduation. I was 21 when I started; the same age as the protagonist. I eventually tired of the card-counting lifestyle and went on to medical school. Chapter 3 in my book is entitled "The World's Biggest ATM". Its all about card-counting and my time at MIT. So I consider myself to be something of an expert on the subject matter in "21". Nothing is portrayed even close to reality in this movie. First of all, card counting itself is not that hard. Any student who can get into MIT can learn to count cards. Its not that mathematical either (in the Thorpe tens/non-tens system you have to do some quick division in your head but they were using a -1, 0, +1- type of system where you only have to add -1, 0 or +1 as each card is played). OK You have to have a good memory and be able to focus intensely without anyone noticing what you are doing. I happen to have a good memory. You probably do too.  It took me three weeks of learning the tables and practicing to become enough of an expert to be able to play in the casino for hours on end without making a mistake. And in case you're wondering...YES it works, But it is a job. With the systems now available, you can get an advantage of 2 or 3 percent over the house (the casino). It doesn't sound like much but if you play 100 hands per 60 minute hour at an average of $100 per hand, you have created $10,000 of "action". 3 % of that is $300. Per hour. And that's about how it works. To get $3,000 per day (more than $ 1 million per year) you have to play 10 hours; or you have to bet more. I played with my own money and needed to play with less at the beginning because you need enough of a bankroll (about 200 x your minimum bet) to make sure an unfortunate run of cards doesn't wipe you out. And unfortunate runs you do get at times. You only average $300 per hour in my example; sometimes  you make more, sometimes less. It's a fairly tedious undertaking that pays off gradually with time, time and more time at the tables. I wanted to love this movie- both subjects are near and dear to my heart- but I had heard that the book wasn't accurate either and I wasn't expecting too much. Even so, the movie (and book too- I eventually read it) fell far short of my low expectations . MIT wasn't portrayed accurately at all, starting with the two idiotic friends. That may be the characarture of MIT but it isn't anything like MIT. In my time there I never met anyone like that. The protagonist was pretty typical, nothing unusual in his abilities or background as MIT standards go. The Kevin Spacey  character could never exist; talking to another professor to get the kid out of an exam and give him an A. What!? And the casino scenes; oh the casino scenes... Those idiotic hand signals? C'mon, the cocktail waitresses would've picked up on those... Lawrence Fishbourne beating the tar out of people he caught counting!? I don't think so. The Nevada State Gaming Commission would shut `em down, pronto. (Getting caught cheating the casino with a dealer or by marking the cards, etc.- that might be different). But counting cards ISN'T ILLEGAL. Its not against the rules to use your brain.  In 2 years of playing on a regular basis (the casinos even pay for your flights and hotel rooms!) and sporadically after that- it really is addictive- nobody ever caught me counting; except once. That time, they just asked us to leave. They said we were disturbing the patrons.  "Gladly", we said, and just walked down the street to the next casino. Part of the problem with the movie is that its hard to make an entire movie about counting. There's just not enough material for a theatrical full-length feature film. (Its much more ideally-suited to a one hour documentary.) Ok, so what to do? Enter the two stupid friends and the side show about the 2.09 contest, the strip-joint girls cashing in the chips, ( I don't think so- a few of them might slip into the ladies room never to be seen again), the sob story about needing the money for medical school, etc. "Excuse me Mr. Future Doctor Millionaire, MIT math genius, Harvard Med Graduate,  don't take your mom's life savings, don't lie about the scholarship, just apply for a student loan like everyone else who's going to medical school." That's why it occupies only one of thirty-six chapters in my book . There's just not that much to the mechanics of counting and making it work in the casinos. The magic in counting cards is in the realization that it is a free ticket to as much money as you will ever want and that you will never have to work again. A "free" ticket? Not exactly. It turns out to be a job like any other. I made that clear in "Striking It Rich" and I too eventually went to medical school and became a surgeon. Who wants to count cards all day when they could do something useful (and if it matters to you) make the same amount of money in the process? Counting cards, MIT math geniuses, the very pretty female protagonist, etc. are all potentially sexy subjects but their sexiness was utterly lost in this book/movie. Where were the consultants who knew something about MIT? Casinos? One of our fine actors, Kevin Spacey, was a producer on this film. How could he let this happen? What were Spacey and the writers thinking? Nix the idiotic characterization of the kid who was making hundreds of thousands counting yet who insisted on stealing everything from bottles of booze to pens from the maid cart, and the entire team who was scared to try it without Spacey's corrupt professor at the helm... Uh, HELLO?- these are supposed to be our best and brightest, Mr. Producers...) A realistic portrayal of MIT students and of MIT, and of casino card counting could have been something  very entertaining. As  a lover of MIT, movies, card-counting, money, sexy, smart women, etc., all I could think was "What a waste!"   
sarcastic Reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS as a 14 year old high school student in 1967 helped me acquire a clearer understanding of the concept of infinity. Eternity could never be as long as this book, which I endured to its soporific, boring end. I recommend it to hold up the end of a busted sofa!
sarcastic I purchased this product in order to spice up my sex life (or 'nasty funtime' as my wife and I call it).  Quite frankly this compact disc has ruined my entire life.  After letting this CD play overnight, I woke up to the surprise of the friggin century.  My nether regions are now nearly the length of a damn football field.  Yeah, thanks ALOT!  I can barely shoehorn myself into a pair of pants and when I finally do, I walk around with a TENTPOLE bulging out the front.  Talk about uncomfortable!  I got fired from my job because they claimed I was being "entirely inappropriate in the workplace."  It's not like I could help it!  On top of that my wife has left me because she's too freaked out to be near me while I'm clothed, much less in the bedroom.  Speaking of freaks, I've had to join a Freak Show in a traveling carnival because they're the only people that would hire me now.  In fact, we may be coming to a town near you.  Keep an eye out for me.  They call me the Amazing Gargantuan Penis Man.  Can't miss me.
sarcastic Timeless works often suffer at the hands of translators. One thinks of the numerous and continuing attempts to render Dante's "Divina Commedia" (another early vernacular Italian masterpiece and contemporary to the justifiably obscure Tuscana Latte series) and the struggle with both terza rima and meaning. No so for Tuscan Whole Milk ("La tutta latte"). Few works are better left where they were found, their authors condemned and eventually flogged. This translation of the redredged third valume of the series was committed by Sir John Stilton, the inebriated English librettist for two of the earliest publicly-immolated operas by P.D.Q Bach, themselves loosely based, in part, on the Tuscan series and "Mechanicae Popularum": "Die Fliegende Kuhe" and "Das Zaubereuter", both banned before their opening nights sometime in the early 1760s.   That Stilton translated the Tuscan series at all was no mere stroke of misfortune. He was a cousin of Leopold von Emmenthaler, present at the Great Flushing of the Florentine sewers in 1755. As recounted in his memoir "Besottene Reisen", returning to his rooms late one night from a drinking binge, Leopold fell into an open ditch which drained into the Arno, but had been clogged. He was saved from drowning in the filth by the floating obstruction created by a massive snarl of wig hair and old used manuscripts -- part of which would later be tragically identified as the only complete copy of "Tuscan." Inspired to further drink by the experience, Leopold vowed to champion the mysterious work. He passed it to Stilton in a stupor sometime in 1759. Though arrested, Leopold was never proscuted for the act and he fled to his native Limburg.  Rarely misunderstood and best left un-retold, "Whole Milk" is the culminating volume of the Tuscan series, but can be read (if necessary) as a standalone work, as both Skim ("Scremato" or "Senza Grassi") and Two-Percent ("Cauto") are diatribes on celibacy and vegetables respectively.  A tale of love, betrayal, and gastrointestinal distress, it is in this infamous portion of the "work" that Contessa Bessi meets the cowherd Giovanni de Sargento (the cloaked "Count Grasso") and confronts him with the immortal question "Gotta de latte?" This dubiuosly romantic passage is considered by some scholars as the inspiration for later poetry (e.g. Wordsworth's "I Wandered Lonely as a Cow" (1804); Dickinson's "#255", (""Cow" is the thing with horns." (1867)), books ("Care of Dairy Cattle in Central Peru" (1843); Proust's "Du Cafe chez Vache" (1914)), and even movies (among them "Cud" (1963) with Paul Newman and Patricia Neal; "El Cud," (1961) with Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren; and "The Guns of Navorone" (1961) with Gregorgy Peck and Anthony Quinn).  This Stilton translation of Tuscan Whole Milk remains one of the more curdling, if only because he manages to improve the flavor of the work to the point that more innocent readers might be unwittingly exposed to it. It is clear that Stilton spoke little Italian, certainly not the 14th century vernacular of the region, and had no concept of style and structure. It is not certain that he was even completely literate in English.  One star for calcium.
sarcastic I knew my day was going to improve when the truck pulled up at my home with this cable deep within. No ordinary truck, this one was Holy White, and the gold Delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe. The driver, clad in a robe colored the softest of white, floated towards me on the cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers. He smiled benevolently, like a father looking down upon his only child, and handed me a package wrapped in gold beaten thin to the point where you could see through it. I didn't have to sign, because the driver could see within my heart, and knew that I was pure. Upon opening the package, an angelic choir started to sing, and reached a crescendo as I laid this cable on my stereo system. Instantly, my antiquated equipment transformed into components made from the clearest diamond-semiconductor. The cable knew where to go, and hooked itself into the correct ports without help from me - all the while, the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god. With trepidation, I pushed "play," and was instantly enveloped in a sound that echoed the creation of all matter, a sound that vibrated every cell in my body to perfection. I was instantly taken to the next plane, where I saw the all-father. I knew with my entire soul, that all was good in the world.  But then I realized the cable was blue, so I only gave it one star. I hate blue.
sarcastic When Big Bobby Ray told me there was a foxy lady's version of that legendary 3 Wolves shirt I just had to get one for myself. Look out Bobby Raye there's a new Loca Lobo in town. My hands trembled when I opened the package and I couldn't get over that lovely Trailer Lavendar color and the almost air-brushed quality of the wolves. I cranked up the Kid Rock, put on my best cut-offs (you know the kind, that ride up just enough in the front and back) gave the bleach blond hair a fresh squirt of Aquanet (roots be darned) and told that Bobby Ray we were loading up in the Trans Am and to let that coon tail fly. These lady wolves really unleash my womanly power, no woman at Wal-mart, the tanning salon, the county fair, the beer joint, or the Nascar race will look hotter. Ok, Verna Sue, we'll see who gets promoted at the feed store now! Especially when I tie the shirt just so and let a little of the jelly hang out- must be jelly cause jam don't shake like that. Just look at those wolves...no one can resist the "come here big boy" look of that she-wolf. Can't wait for this Friday night when Bobby and I wear our matching wolf redneck couture line and go down to the Bingo hall and then when we get home...if the trailer's rockin' don't bother knockin. All thanks to this graceful wolf finery- get yours cause I got mine.
sarcastic I am an acquisitions officer for an artillery unit in the Russian Army. Since mafia hooligans stole all of our equipment to sell to Kyrgyzstani rebels, we have been looking for a low-cost alternative to the T-80 Main Battle Tank. After successful trials at a facility in Moscow, this so-called "Badonkadonk" was approved for use in the Chechen theatre. Initial reports were favorable, but then somebody noticed that the tank lacked a cannon, treads, and armor, and possessed the engine of an electric bicycle. It did, however, have an excellent audio system, but this failed to compensate for its disappointing 100% mortality rate. Recommended only for use against Lithuanians.
sarcastic Wow... the first one was at least good to read the first time, but this just sucked.   I'm the kind of girl who hated Romeo and Juliet. I hated the way they committed suicide over each other, and how Juliet picked Romeo over actually having a life even though being with Romeo meant suicide. Therefore, it's not to hard to figure out that I wasn't all too fond of this.  I actually don't know who I pity more: me, for reading this book when Chinese water torture might have been preferable, the editor for having to fix it from whatever level of absolute hopelessness it was in to the level of suckiness that it became, or Bella whose love left her (a sign to get over them to anyone reading this- don't wallow over some idiot) and was adament about their inexistent future together in the first place. Hm. Real tuffie. I don't know if me or the editor had it worse.   What about Bella? Who cares, she was an idiot.   And if love makes people fools, then it's not all its cracked up to be and I'm fine being single.
sarcastic If you are overweight, or even sensitive about your weight, don't read this book! Iovine can't resist saying "fat" without adding "and ugly" and she states in the beginning that overweight couch potatoes are not welcome in her circle of "girlfriends." Towards the end of the book, she discusses the pregnant waddle, and reasons that all fat people waddle a bit anyway. She sympathizes with her husband for not being attracted to her. After all, you wouldn't want to sleep with someone as fat as you, right? And she confides that her maternity wardrobe ran all the way up to a (gasp) size ten! The horror! Although this book was very entertaining and had some good information, I got tired of being slapped every couple of pages. The author simply can't resist seperating her temporarily round self from those of us who struggle with our weight all the time. Does she not realize that the average American woman is a size 14? I really felt like I was reading this book as an outsider, so I waited until a skinny friend got pregnant and gave it to her. And by the way, Ms. Iovine, I am a size 16 and my husband can't keep his hands off me. It would take a lot more than pregnancy and dark roots to push him away. If your husband is that picky about your looks, I feel sorry for you.
sarcastic Ingmar right before me says it all. What kind of human being could watch this grotesque, unbelievably carnivorous gore and call it entertainmnet? Anyone with eyes and a mind can see that our society will revel in even the worst garbage. Blindly this was ordered and from the cat being wantonly killed and barbequed and fed to a rat is when I SHOULD have stopped but this masterpiece of manure was continued only because Denzel Washington (in my mind) would in a while bring something positive.  When my morning coffee started to come back up, the movie was put up for sale on Amazon. Shame on me for thinking that anything Washington was in would have to be redeemable.  HEED MY WORDS: THIS IS NOT FOR ANYONE WITH A FAINT HEART OR AN AWARENESS OF THE VALUE OF LIFE. If all Hollywood can come up with is this crap then lets go back to looking at carvings on caves!
sarcastic Sex For Dummies: I saw this book while perusing Amazon, and could not believe it. Not only is this company marketing their products to mentally-challenged people, but they are doing it right out in the open! Surely the mentally-handicapped, who oftentimes work menial jobs for little or no pay, need their money more than any other group? But no, this soulless corporation keeps churning out their books designed to take our slower brothers' and sisters' last dime. How exactly are the books "For Dummies?" I'm not sure; perhaps they have large, colorful pictures or have scratch-and-sniff components. No matter, the point still stands that this company is trying to take advantage of the mentally-impared and must be stopped.  And furthermore, "Sex for Dummies?" Really? I'm as liberal as the next guy, but are the mentally-challenged really the kind of people we want reproducing? I'm not saying we round them up into camps or anything, but if you can figure out a way to keep `em childless, so much so the better.  To conclude: Not only does this book take advantage of the less-fortunate, but it strives to create a world in which there are even more of said less-fortunate. Two stars.  
sarcastic I bought this before reading the reviews, which is unlike me.  Once I saw the experiences the other buyers had had, I was nervous, but convinced myself that it would be fine.  I run XP, so I downloaded the software from the Gravis site, installed everything, and tried a game.  The D pad wouldn't work, despite the fact that I had downloaded the XP software.  If this had been the only problem, I would have figured that I had just done something wrong, but the joysticks were awful!  Half the time, I would move the joystick up, to move forward, and when I released it my character kept going forward.  Not great when you're standing on the edge of a cliff.  I found it impossible to get any kind of control over my game characters, not nearly enough to even consider being able to use the gamepad for games.  Another thing about the gamepad is that, although I tried it in the store, to get a feel for it, I decided rather quickly that, regardless of how it worked, it just wasn't right for my small hands (I'm female, and have exceptionally small hands).  I can't call this a complaint, just a matter of personal preference.  When I viewed the "Read Me" file on this thing, and came to the section about "Known Bugs", I about had a heart attack at all of the problems this thing is "known" to have!  After every single bug listed, they gave a completely lame, unsatisfactory "solution".  For instance, one bug said that games often take a moment to respond to input from the controller.  Their solution? "Please wait a moment after each button click, to give the game time to respond".  Erm, sure; I'll just politely ask 200 Orcs to stop attacking me while Aragorn takes a moment to respond, no problem.  I'm not by any means an extremely serious gamer with unrealistically high expectations for my equipment; I just like to play sometimes, and want moderately sufficient results.  This controller came nowhere near that, and I'll be returning it tomorrow morning, after only owning it for about 18 hours.
sarcastic The Zenith Men's Defy Xtreme Tourbillon Titanium Chronograph Watch or Z.M.D.X.T.B.T.C.M. as I like to call it, is by far the most awesome watch. Chuck Norris riding into the Super Bowl on the back of Godzilla and round house kicking the crowd is no where near as awesome as this priceless poon magnet. When I was just moments from sending my $100k to some needy neo-hippie help group, I stumbled onto this gem. It was like the heavens opened and Jesus himself appeared with this same watch on. I mean how can you not follow Jesus when he's rocking a watch of this caliber. So I asked "What would Jesus do?" Jesus pimp smacked me and said "Forget those hippies, buy the watch!" I was like "HECK YEAH." I busted out my Discover card and bought this rocking piece of art. I mean its art but its also practical too. Like when I take my summer trips to the Marianas Trench, I have no more worries that I am going to miss Tea Time back on the yacht, because water ruined my watch again. It can withstand the immense pressures of the deep due to the wicked awesome titanium. Deep seas, cant beat this. Bullets cant beat this. Heck, I can deflect cruise missiles and the apocalypse. With a watch like this you don't need to tell time, you tell people what time it is.
sarcastic My children are always complaining about eating that or saying that. It get's seriously annoying and Mighty putty claims to fix leaks, so I put it to the test and now I can drive hour long car rides with little to no problem.
sarcastic Did you analyze the water or just making generalizations ("it certainly removes harmful bacterial, cysts, and protozoa.")  Yeah, thought so.
sarcastic You can expect to get, MAYBE, 20 to 30 batches of waffles before this thing will burn out.  We gave one to my brother for Christmas two years ago and it died after about 10 batches.  He took it back and the second one died; and the third one.  I think he has given up on it.  Same with my mother-in-law's waffle maker and now ours, a gift for Christmas last year, went D.O.A. this morning!  I guess we'll have to go out for waffles today.    Hey Waring, you might want to re-think your engineering department!  It's a waffle maker...not the Space Shuttle...how hard could it be to make it last more than 20 cycles?!
sarcastic Wow what a way to start off your career with one of the best debut albums ever! This album is non-stop rock. And I don't mean fake rock such as The Who or Led Zeppelin; I mean stuff that actually takes TALENT to creat (those guys were just hippies on acid trips who have no ability to create good music). Ashlee can play instuments for the record, I've even seen a picture of her with a guitar which proves it. She composed this music ON HER OWN and didn't just touch up her voice in the studio like these posers will tell you. Also you bitch about her lip synching. Well LOL everybody does it LOL. You should get this, but ignore talentless poser "singers" such as Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.
sarcastic This is atrocious.  I'm watching "Life" on Discovery channel right now, with Oprah narrating.  Some of the reviewers said that the script was re-written for her, and I can believe it.  I can't believe Attenborough saying lines like "hunting crab seals is toooo much work!"  Oprah narrates this thing as if she were reading a bedtime story to little kids and comes off as snarky and condescending.  In the opening segment, she's discussing a fox chasing an ibex kid and it's basically like "heeeere comes the fox!  UH OH!!"  The most embarrassing thing is that I'm thinking that British people think that Americans demanded this.  Who's going to be doing the next special, Dr. Phil?  "Oh-kaaay, here comes the alee-gaytor, it's prey tries to run, but that neeeever works!  HAW HAW HAW!"  Don't get this.  Get the real version.
sarcastic More contemptable garbage from the likes of another extreme Conservative.  The majority of the book doesn't even contain facts.  It reads more like a trashy magazine with the same amount of false allegations that themselves amount to nothing.  Perhaps a revised copy of the book should be released and retitled:  Hell to Pay:  The Same Old Right-Wing Story of SENATOR Hillary Rodham Clinton.
sarcastic Chuck Norris does it again people. The man can do no wrong. He takes such a stupid subject as a police dog movie, eats it and then craps out a police dog diamond. There's just too much to say about this movie. The characters are amazing, the script is beyond fantastic, the story has an awesome pace and is truly believable and the special effects and action sequences will blow your mind. Of course, there's also the Chuckster, ah Chuck with your wonderful beard and fantastic haircuit, you dazzle again. Chuck delivers his lines like a pro and his stunts are some of the best I've ever seen. There is almost nothing better in this world than putting on some Yanni and turning on a Chuck Norris movie like Top Dog and getting lost in the amazing world that Chuck Norris shapes for us. This is a must buy for any fan of fine film, it's definitely in the top 3 greatest movies of all time list.
sarcastic I was chuckling to myself, reading all the great reviews of this product, thinking, "do I have the same monitor?  Am I doing something wrong?".  Then I got to the reviews at the bottom of the page in which other customers were having the same beeping problem as me.  Thank goodness!  We have the baby in a room on the same floor as us -- the monitor is maybe 15 feet away...and it beeps randomly all the time.  God forbid I move it maybe 20 feet away from the base - forget it!  I am out of range (and the monitor doesn't let me forget it - which is good - but I don't feel like I should be out of range at this distance).  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this monitor to anyone, unless you enjoy not sleeping - not due to a baby crying, but rather your monitor beeping!
sarcastic I'm fortunate enough to be haunted by a ghost that is actually made out of electricity. The EMF Detector has consequently proved effective at tracking down Moaning Electro Horror Child even when she's hiding in hard to spot places like the cupboard where we keep the Christmas decorations. Highly recommended.  EDIT: I am upset to report that as a result of successfully capturing and banishing above ghost, it has returned in anger to horribly slay my family. I now wish I had never purchased the device. Not recommended.
sarcastic This is truly a spectacular movie in the tradition of Showgirls and Battlefield Earth.  It is one of those movies in which you know the people both on and off screen actually THINK they are making a quality product, but the result is so horrifying as to make it magnificent. Everything about this movie, including, but not limited to, the cheesy and overdone soundtrack (minor key, I should feel sad right now), the horribly written dialog, the wooden delivery (there were a few scenes where I swear Affleck was reading off of a cue card), and the incoherent plot, make this movie one for the ages.  While I don't think it really deserves it's current position as #1 on the top 100 worst films of all time on IMDB, it is definitely in the top 10.   I saw it in the theater with about 6 other people and we all could not stop laughing.  Truly a trainwreck of a movie.
sarcastic All my life, I've been looking for the one thing that would turn me to religion...and BEHOLD! I found it...  Instead of boooooring pictures of the Last Supper and the probable locations of holy sites, I get AWESOME pictures of crashes and and cars going in circles! I could practically smell the burning rubber and see the girls in halter tops firing cheap t-shirts out of a cannon at me...all the while learning who begat Bathsheba! (SPOILER ALERT: It was Eliam)  There is no better feeling than cracking open a six-pack on a Sunday morning and sitting down and reading my Stock Car bible. Because if there's one thing religion needs...it's definitely DRAFTING!
sarcastic I ordered a Dell Inspiron laptop 1 1/2 years ago and it worked great until recently.  The screen went black and the system would not start.  Turned out that the video card had failed.    I contacted Dell customer support to activate my next business day warranty and after more than a week I have gotten nowhere with them.  My claim has been "escalated" twice with the same excuses and refusal to fix the problem.  They claim they have no video cards in stock and I will have to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement card, 2-3 weeks for a loaner system, or 2-3 weeks for a replacement system -- basically my NEXT DAY warranty is anything but.  I explained that this is a mission critical system and a 2-3 week delay is unacceptable given the high price I paid for the next day warranty.  I offered to take another make or model of graphics card and even offered to go buy the card myself if the agreed to pay for it.    They refused to help in any way.  So, I am left with a useless laptop for 2-3 weeks until it becomes convenient for them to honor the warranty.  I will never buy another Dell product again and recommend that others who are not technically experienced with fixing computers or that need a "mission critical" system that they look elsewhere because Dell cannot be relied upon to fix broken systems in a timely manner.
sarcastic The Emperor has no clothes!  In the best tradition of Saul Alinsky's "Rules for Radicals" Fifth Rule, Laura Ingraham has effectively ridiculed our Pompous President.  Since most of his actions are too outrageous for simple reporting, Laura has had to resort to satire to properly describe the Obumbler.  It's about time that someone told the real truth about our Marxist-in-residence at the White House.
sarcastic The literary equivalent of toe cheese, this is Hatriot Glenn Beck's lame attempt to capitalize on "tea party" hysteria with his knock off of "The Turner Diaries."  It's been found to cause retardation in lab rats. Avoid it at all costs.
sarcastic I hate this book beyond belief. The book lacks a little thing called substance. I wanted to just strangle the main character Mac. She was a little defenseless Barbie stereotype, whose delicate southern female sensibilities were hurt when somebody so much as cursed! She cant lift a finger to defend herself, and would rather slouch off her parents with a part time job, work on her tan, then do ANYTHING. It had immense potential when it came to plot but the characters made it unenjoyable. Jericho was a horrible character who did nothing but yell, bruise, and order Mac around. None of the characters are well written and have as much substance as a toilet brush, not to mention that Mac is the most worthless excuse for a heroin in any book I have read so far. Don't wast your money on this book.
sarcastic As a Grey, I found this book to be entirely slanderous of me and my people and our mission on Earth. We are not here to "abduct" you, perform horrible experiments and make you doubt the reality of your own petty, wormlike existences. We are here as mere researchers, trying to discover what it is about humanity that makes you so... special. If the advice in this book were to be taken, why, our research would come to a complete standstill! Without subjects to study, how can we know more about you and your inconsequential lives? We are on your planet for entirely peaceful reasons, and not - I repeat NOT - here to steal your genetic material to build an invincible army to utterly annihilate those crustaceous scum on Alpha Centauri.  What's more, it would completely mess up the fourth season of "Who Wants to Be an Earthling," and you really don't want to screw with the networks like that.  Don't buy this book! Think about the bigger picture!
sarcastic I was given the Three Wolf Moon shirt as a gift for my departure from my current job assignment.  Immediately upon donning the shirt, I was attacked by mobs of women at the pub.  My wife was actually trampled to death by the sudden rush of women.  Fortunately, the 3 wolves soothed my grief  . . . and taught me to fly.  After taking a quick aerial cruise around England, I returned to my compatriots.  It was a difficult landing, due largely in part to the throngs of women in waiting.  After using my laser vision to clear an LZ, I regained my Earthly contact (if you can call constant hovering "contact").  The Ancient Egyptians believed that the difference between a king and a pharaoh was that pharaohs were actually gods on Earth.  After placing the shirt upon my body, I was aware of the state of reverence in which pharaohs were held.  This was due in large part to the fact that all about me (approx. 300 people/worshippers) were laying prostrate before my holy visage.  King Tut has nothing on me thanks to Three Wolf Moon.   I did notice a minor drawback to Three Wolf Moon.  It involved the inability to make things explode with my mind.  I felt it was a basic application of The Shirt.  Apparently, I bought a knockoff because my friend purchased Three Wolf Moon and was instantly able to blow up the head of the guy who was sleeping with his girlfriend.  I wanted to use it to destroy Fenway Park and allow Wrigley Field to be the sole historical ballpark, but apparently I purchased The Shirt from a different supplier than Pocahontas.
sarcastic I understand that most of the reviews are fake and I would like to say that while I find them all very enjoyable and humorous, there is a something that a real customer of this product feels should be known.  I purchased 10 of the rabbits for the purpose of making hare jerky (a tasty treat) when I was overcome with the desire to indulge in a bit of rabbit meat before the smoking process. Giving into my guilty urges, I took one rabbit for my own personal pre-jerky consumption and proceeded to eat the entire animal whole (I do not own a stove, only a plastic box and some firewood for smoking things, hence it was uncooked). After my little personal rabbit fiesta, I laid down to digest the food.  This was a mistake. Within two hours, I had never felt worse. I used the trusty search engine "Bing" to do some armchair medical research while clutching a trashcan in the most horrendous gastric distress you can imagine (I do not have health insurance so I did not call the hospital). Quickly, I found out that a side effect to eating rabbit was "protein poisoning," a situation that arises when lean meat is eaten. It is also known as "rabbit starvation" because rabbit meat contains almost no fat whatsoever. Apparently, consumption of large amounts of protein with little or no carbohydrates or fat is dangerous. Well you imagine how much that tickled me angry. All ready to write an angry letter of protest to the rabbit meat industry about their marketing of a dangerous foodstuff, I stumbled to my writing desk but alas, I only made it 3 feet before collapsing in pain. The next 5 hours were like a blur as I lay on the floor writhing in my own waste seeing people and things from the past and quite possibly the future. I have experimented with drugs back in the day and let me tell you, nothing came as close to disconnecting me from the universe in the worst way possible, as this. No one ever wants to experience protein poisoning, I promise you.  At about 10 in the evening I came to and used a chair and the wall to help pull myself off of the floor. I still felt sick and I went back to my computer to see if there was a cure. Suddenly it hit me, I needed to eat other macronutrients! I remembered the tub of lard I had been saving in the fridge and stumbled across my apartment. The pain only grew worse. I remembered reading that bodybuilders eat lots of protein. I have no idea how they do it. It must be horrible for them. My vegan friend has always said that anything over 20 grams of a protein a day is overkill and I'm inclined to believe him now. He is the healthiest person I know, he is very skinny but he doesn't have visible muscle (which he says is the result of toxins and not enough body fat to properly survive). I finally reached my fridge and reached in for the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter container with my stockpiled lard. I quickly shoveled it into my mouth and wouldn't you believe it but it only made me feel worse! I passed out again, the cold air of the fridge blowing onto me.  I awoke three days later (according to my watch) at 7 at night. The fridge had apparently preserved my body as it fought the proteins for the first night but now my electricity was off because my bill was due yesterday. It didn't matter, my body had apparently started to win the fight around 2 nights ago and now I am pretty much back to normal. However, I SINCERELY DO NOT RECOMMEND RABBIT MEAT as it can potentially kill you, as it nearly did me.  Five stars - 1 for nearly killing me - 1 slightly chewy - 1 no head + 1 made great jerky = 3 stars
sarcastic This product,  if it works,  couldn't light up a dandelion let alone a tree or address sign.   I am very disappointed in this product and would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone else.
sarcastic Who would have thought that chrome metal would make such an outstanding instrument!  And to think, the wooden one I have always used could be replaced!  NO MORE SPLINTERS!
sarcastic First off the title of this review may be a little misleading. The handsom Cat Collage t-shirt isn't really greater than Success or happiness, because it actually provides both those things. I found this t-shirt in the alley behind the Kmart near my car (Now most people will say "your car can be anywhere, it moves dummy" not this car, shes just for sleeping, and pretending to wait for someone in). Why anyone would throw this shirt will always be a mystery.   I haven't taken this shirt off since I found it. There are a few reasons for that. The first is that when I wear it I feel respected. When I walk down the street now large crowds of people seem to part, and they look at me with a kind of controlled fear. I believe this is because of the evil eye the tiger on the right gives anyone with fear or doubt in their hearts. The tiger on left gives stink-eyes to anyone who asks me if i'm leaving my parking spot.  The second reason i have yet to remove this shirt is because i have now set the fashion bar too high. I can't downgrade. Where am I going to find something as striking and visually pleasing to wear on my laundry day? The answer is nothing. Short of tatooing this image on my chest there is nothing earthly or celestial origin that can hold a candle to this beautiful fleece of black and blue. It is an understatement to say that this shirt is screen printed with a mixture of assertiveness and courage with a hint of playful instability. Its simply an eyegasm.  The third reason i haven't taken this shirt off is because it was wet when i first put it on, and due to a sort of full-body trenchfoot i can no longer remove this shirt without a surgical procedure or i risk infection or possibly death.  Saying that it is pleasing to the eye is simply an understatement. Look at it. It has 8 of the most beautifully drawn cats in the world on it. It has the type of cluttered variety that most t-shirt artist won't even attempt. Why wouldn't you want lions AND tigers on your shirt at the same time? Are you racist or something? I hope not. I think if 8 consenting cats want to get together on a t-shirt then by golly this is America and they should be allowed to. So big up to the BCC (Big Cat Collage T-shirt). If you want to do the most satisfying, enjoyable thing you have ever done in your life you will purchase this shirt. If you want to keep you job or make friends then go shop at the Gap or something.
sarcastic I went into Watchmen with high expectations because I know that it's suppose to be like the best graphic novel ever. but I was not only horribly disappointed, but utterly disgusted.  Watchmen is a film filled with over the top preachy narration and lines with little storyline advancement because of all the flashbacks and tries to make you understand the alternate history, that the first 3/4 of the film you have absolute no idea what it's trying to get at (unless, of course you are familiar with the graphic novel it's based upon). Then at the end you realize that it's the same old same old (though only universaly WESTERN idealism):  * human beings are inheritantely corrupt (thanks alot) * peace can only be achieved through catastrophe, in other words, without apocalyse or apocalyptical events, there can only be war (which I only agree to the degree that if you kept trying to convince people this, the religious fundies ought to be VERY HAPPY when they see this film) * There has to be a god-like scapegoat for it to be happen, and it's gonna be American (sorry Jesus Christ), and he will not actually be responsible for the apocalypse, only scapegoating it (ergo: if some God-like creature destroyed the entire human race, it's probably not his fault but corrupt human beings')  last but not least that made me most angry: *women: if you got pregnant from rape, you should ALWAYS have the kid, because the kid will always turn out to be the best thing that ever happen to you.   I have to admit that Watchmen hides its clichedness well, it wasn't until the very end did I actually realize all this. But there was a point in which I thought it might head into a though-provoking direction, that it might actually get at a point that makes you go "hmm... interesting," and that's when Dr. Manhattan raise the conscience: what is so special about the lives of human beings, or lives in general, most part of galaxy (or universe if you'll make that assumption that earth is unique with life) get along just fine without life.   Interestingly good point, cool, that made me think for a moment  then it got destroyed by the bottom-of-the barrel foolish "epiphany" of Dr. Manhattan that he should save human race because of Silk Spectral number two, because she is something good that came out of chaos. Therefore life must be special if "good life" can come out of chaos.  If you just sit there and think this though for a moment you'll see that this logic makes absolutely NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. Why? because if you already take the assumption that all lives (and non-lives) are equal, as Dr. M suggests because he's so high and mighty and all that, then how would "rape" be catagorized as "chaos?" Rape and rape-like things happen often in the animal and, some would argue, plant and bacterial kingdom. It's only the fact that rape brings suffering to human beings, and we, the human beings, must PERCEIVE it as chaos because it brings suffering to us (mostly the women), will makes it "chaos." So you must assume that:  1. there's something special and non-chaotic (good) about human lives 2. Rape brings suffering/chaos therefore conclusion: 3. rape is chaotic.  So this sudden "epiphany" of Dr. M basically just came out of nowhere, maybe it's because he does believe that human lives are special but just doesn't wanna show it since he's god and all that and it's just too humiliating and difficult to suffer in love in his condition. Not to mention after all the talk of anti-life, he's actually pro-life (not even pro-choice)!!  A friend suggested to me that (he has read the graphic novel) the point is the irony: corrupted human beings (the watchmen) are the ones to rise above to save the human race.  interesting but whether or not the graphic novel perserves this idea, the movie certainly does not. Why? because the watchmen (in the movie) who actually fought the crimes either did it to appease their own vanity (to be like pharohs, to bring divine justice) or did it for thrills (which is like most of them). Hey apocalypse is coming, what better way to spend your Last Days then to have sex and kick some butt? Dude I would totally go for it.   Overall this film is painful to watch, especially for humanists/feminists like me. The only thing I learned from this film is that kept getting people paranoid about world-ending does it's self-fufilling prophecy thing. Sadly I already knew that since I have a B.A. in Psychology.
sarcastic If Tori Spelling ever had anything remotely interesting on her mind (which is debatable), she has now officially run out of thoughts. Her third book "Uncharted TerriTORI" is an exercise in vapidity, in which Spelling disingenuously rambles on about the exact same subjects that her previous books were about -- and honestly, she usually comes across as a spoiled brat playing at being a grown-up.  A lot of her essays are on pretty mundane events -- meeting her hubby's understandably bitter ex-wife, the woes of motherhood, family vacations, stress, clinginess towards friends, jury duty, meeting her grandparents, her son's first day at school, swine flu, and so on. In the hands of a more self-aware person this wouldn't be a problem, but Spelling acts as if she is literally the first person to ever experience these things.  And she rambles about far less mundane things: what meanies the 90210 cast are (according to her, she was the "sweet" one and they should just LOVE her), sex in a hospital bed, overcoming the paparazzi, starring in a reality show, the terrors of staying at a cheap motel, and adopting a pig. Plus, she tries to overcome her aviatophobia by going to a psychic AND a past-life specialist, and tries to cure headaches with voodoo BEFORE consulting a doctor. Only in L.A., people.  "Uncharted TerriTORI" is basically a big puff pastry, filled with air and flakes -- and reading it is a lot like listening to someone nattering about the minutiae of their uninteresting life. Tori Spelling seems to have two modes of thought: either she is desperately trying to convince us that she's "just people" or she's dissecting mundane events and blowing them WILDLY out of proportion.   So unsurprisingly, a lot of "Uncharted TerriTORI" is painfully boring, as Spelling either does boring stuff or contemplates her own surgically-enhanced navel. The entire book is written in a coyly disingenuous style, with all the boring stuff only broken by moments of unintentionally hilarious melodrama -- just look at the scene where Spelling's husband rips out her IV and carries her (soap opera style) through the hospital, yelling for doctors. Who can take that seriously?  Spelling herself doesn't come across too well -- she seems pampered, clingy, whiny, and laughably entitled ("Maybe I was born into wealth as punishment for my behavior asn an Egyptian pharoah"). Additionally, her obsession with herself (a whole chapter on TWEETING!) is just painful. And though she spends a LOT of time trying to convince us that her marriage is not "loveless" as the tabloids say, her husband comes across as a manipulative creep who is just tolerating her.  "Uncharted TerriTORI" is an exercise in tedium, similar to dragging yourself across a very long bed of nails -- boring, painful and seemingly never over.
sarcastic A perfect date movie: you'll miss absolutely nothing of merit if you make out in the back row instead of watching the film.  
sarcastic Make no mistake, this is a candy bar masquarading as a nutrition bar.  With whopping 9 grams of sugar ( 45 calories ) almost 1/3 of the calories in total, you'll have a much more pleasant experience having a small candy bar.  I found the taste and texture so awful I had to spit it out.  To the delight of my squirrel friends, I tossed the rest of the bar outside where they promptly gobbled it up.  This is a gimmick created by this Dr. for cash purposes.  If he's such a great diet Dr., why doesn't he recommend you eat plain nuts?  An apple?  A yogurt?  There is nothing magical about this bar - eat ANYTHING that contains 170 calories with a glass of water a half hour before your meal and you'll probably be just as full.
sarcastic Just one example:  "Killing talk radio" is actually reviving the Fairness Doctrine where the media were required to allow alternate points of view.   Ronald Reagan killed this doctrine, allowing guys like Rush Limbaugh to spew their distortions and right wing propaganda nonstop for three hours every day of the week, with no one to challenge them.  Is allowing alternate points of view a bad thing?  Funny how the media is supposedly controlled by the liberals, but it is the conservatives who are so afraid of having alternate points of view.  Don't waste your time on this trash.
sarcastic Do you feel your child is about to go into the world without all the "necessary" skills? Do you feel your loved one isn't adequately prepared to face life's most daunting challenges? Have you ever wondered what to do if you're stuck on a raising drawbridge? Are you so paranoid that you look for an escape to every situation? If you answered yes to any and/or all of these questions, then buy this book, NOW! This is your bible to every worst-case situation that life may throw at you, and more.  But don't think this is strictly a humor book, and sure it may contain some of that, like how to escape from a costumed character/mascot, or you should escape a meeting by crawling under the table, but there's plenty of serious entries to go along. For example, if your elevator is plummeting, something I fear all the time, then you should lie flat on your stomach to distribute the force. They do go to experts for many of these entries, and although I wouldn't like to test any of them, I'm sure they're pretty useful in the situation.  It's the best-of the long-time series, sure to help with most any predicament you may find yourself in. And for further reference, this edition contains a CD with ever scenario, in full, complete with a few wallpapers and screensavers for good measure. Just be warned, every scenario is in Adobe Acrobat format, which I hate since it's such a difficult program to navigate.  Overall, you can't go wrong in giving this as a gift to somebody, whether you're giving it to them for practical or enjoyment purposes. I highly recommend it for any rainy day, paranoid people, or anybody who just ever wondered what to do if... well, you get the point.
sarcastic Immediately upon seeing the infomercial about the Snuggie, I was ecstatic!  I have been too stupid to use a normal blanket my whole life.  I often find myself violently exasperated when I am forced to answer the phone and my blanket falls off one shoulder, leaving me achingly cold.  I mean, why are blankets so slippery????  People have only been using blankets in one form or another since the dawn of man.....and they are just so damn inconvenient!  I have often expressed frustration with a society that forces us to conform to such barbaric notions at the "blanket."   Well, never again, my friend.  Never again.  Seriously.  This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen.  If I get one for christmas, I'm turning it into a dog bed.
sarcastic Sorry to see Charlaine Harris join the list of writers who are so driven by deadline pressure they can't create.  Remember what we all learned in elementary school, faced with that blank sheet of paper?  You can't just order up creativity and expect it to be good.  This is the third one of my favorite authors with series pressure to dissapoint.  Beware when an author thanks so many other people for their "help"!  Last time I looked, most great fiction was not written by a committee.  Harris is brilliant, when Harris is writing.  This looked like an outline, with some help from Harris and a lot of suggestions from other people.  People saying, write about Alcide.  Write about politics.  Write about fairy politics, etc.  There is no plot, no main conflict, no main resolution, no basic novel elements.  And we know Harris can write one hell of a plot when she is on her game.  I would rather the publisher just said "Harris has writer's block" than churn out this overpriced drivel with her name on it.  I would be willing to wait.  And tell the darn committee to leave her alone.
sarcastic I don't understand why anybody thinks this is at all good.  I'm a sci-fi geek through and through, from all the Star Treks, both BSG's, all the Stargates, Babylon 5 (and it's ill-fated spinoff Crusade), I'm usually cool with anything in space.  But my god.  Ridiculous? Awful? Cause of severe eye-bleeding? I'm not sure how I can really describe this show.  I probably even managed to make it through half the episodes without knowing or caring who was doing what before I gave up and sold it on here to some poor misguided soul. The acting is bad.  So is the writing.  And the western style is absurd.  Why in the H would people redevelop western accents?  Is the medieval British accent making a comeback? The whole thing is just a complete waste of a show.
sarcastic If you're looking for REAL heavy metal and if you are sick of that old fake crap (Megadeth, Dream Theater, 80s Metallica, Iron Maiden, Opeth, Queensryche, Borknagar etc - basically any of the clowns that only posers with no taste praise) then look no further. They show other talentless poser "metal" bands that solos suck and when they actually do solo - they do it better than any of those losers in the 80s. They show unknown posers with guitars like Malmsteen, Satriani, McLaughlin, Michael Romeo etc how to REALLY play an instrument. When I listen to this I feel soooooo deep. Like Amy lee, I am a tortured artist and too complicated and intelligent for the world to understand. That's why I'm anti-authority and anti-mainstream. Thankfully MTV caters to rebels such as myself.    LONG LIVE METAL!!!!1
sarcastic My 8 year old suffers from life threatening peanut allergies. Until I found this wonderful Soviet Russian made civilian/military gas mask manufactured just for children, my son Herbert spent 95% of his time under a sealed bubble tent at home. This excellent mask has really been a godsend as Herbert is now able to attend school, participate in his favorite sports, go to the movies, enjoy the Cub Scouts, etc. The large filter canister fits easily into the matching haversack which also carries his school books and other supplies. He does complain that the mask is hot and cumbersome but his words are muffled and well, easy to ignore. It is after all in his best interest. He will come to understand when he gets older.
sarcastic I originally bought workout pants made out of France's flag, but whenever my workout partner Hans would come over, for some reason they would turn completely white, a breeze would come out of nowhere, and they'd start flapping/waving in his direction.  Weird.  Anyway, since I got these star spangled beauties, I threw the other ones away.  And the best part is, I can wash them in hot water to get them really clean, because these colors don't run.
sarcastic An unknown author tries to "uncover" the Tiger Woods story?  We all know what happened that night.  This book is not worth the $15 for a used book.  Save your money.  Steve Helling; try getting a real story next time.  Stop wasting our time with this junk.
sarcastic Let's start off by saying that I am a big supporter of Apple and their products as well as a proud owner of an iMac, Macbook, iPods, and now the latest and greatest iPhone 4. And being the Apple fan (geek) that I am, I followed the live blog updates from WWDC 2010 a couple of weeks back to get the latest news on the unveiling of the phone. Announcements were being made for awesome new features like Facetime, Retina Display, etc. etc. and... drumroll please... a $29 piece of plastic combined with rubber that only went around the edge of the phone? Really? I mean, I understand that the back is left open for aesthetic purposes (baby got back) but I'm pretty sure that when I drop my phone (and I will drop my phone), my phone is most likely going to land on the back or the front and not on its side. So... I did a little bit of searching and this product was one the of few that took advantage of the iPhone leak (thanks to the guy who "left it at the bar"). And it really did take advantage. Very good fit, durable material, cut outs that make sense. And it didn't cost me 29 bucks. What more can I say? It's a case that fits and does what it supposed to do which is to protect the phone. And apparently also prevent signal loss to people who hold it in their left hand (I guess you can't post links in a review but if you check out engadget, there are a number of articles that will convince you that a case WITH a closed back is very much needed to protect your investment). Apple should've included the bumper in the packaging but hey, that's how businesses make money. So until they make a bumper where it can shoot laser beams or bring about world peace for a whopping 29 bucks, I think I will be sticking with this case.
sarcastic This book is a classic..... by what criteria, however, is beyond me. The foremost impression it gives is that of an oppressive tedium. Read fifty pages, you'll be bored. Read fifty more, you will surely feel your brain turning to lead. If there are any real characters under the absolutely arbitrary routines of the wretchedly two dimensional people who populate this book, well then they are buried under the crushing weight of circularly formatted lists chronicling the daily activities of these fickle, unmotivated drunks with no imaginations. Who happen to be getting bored and drunk in pretty places. Trust me, absolutely nothing happens, WHATSOEVER.  The lost generation this may have been. Judging by this book, what they really were missing was personality, a sense of purpose, and the ability to conceive of even a single shred of worthwhile, memorable drama. Lost all right. I dare you to try and read this and not lose your mind.
sarcastic Like many suburban homeowners, I like to kill and eat the wild animals that populate my backyard. To keep it sporting, I hunt naked, with my teeth and long sharpened fingernails as my only weapons. I've feasted on squirrel, raccoon, vole and numerous songbirds. But no matter how long I lay spread eagle and motionless in the hot noonday sun, I have never been able to outwit and catch any of the plump and juicy rabbits that hop just outside my reach and then bolt for the woods when I leap forward with a blood-curdling shriek. I have chased them at a dead run through the yards of the many unoccupied homes that surround mine but the pursuit always ends in frustration. But no more, thanks to Amazon. Every week, I order a fresh whole rabbit and affix it to a remote control car that is operated by one of my children. This way, I get the thrill of the hunt, and when the car's batteries are exhausted, I can leap upon it, bury my teeth into the rabbit's soft flesh and perform my ritual victory dance right there in the Walgreen's parking lot.
sarcastic  When I saw this image, I knew it would put my neighbor's patriotic lawn display of painting the rusted car on his front lawn red white and blue, and draping his trailer with American flags stolen from the memorial cemetery, to total shame. I'm going to wear it while sitting in front of my home in an inflatable kid's pool while knocking back the cold ones all summer just to rub it in his face!
sarcastic Putting this movie in your player can clear a room faster than a Fire Alarm. It was apparent when HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I was released that Mel Brooks had blown his comedic gift, but I doubt anyone expected the man behind the truly great YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN to bottom out as completely as he did here. Witless and torturously unfunny, with nearly every tired, corny gag ponderously telegraphed minutes in advance, (It's...the...Statue...of...Liberty...                                                                 "Planet...Of...the...Apes"...joke...coming...up...in...a...moment).There's really no way for me to convey how unremittingly awful SPACEBALLS is. When I saw it in the theater, I can recall only two genuine laughs in the entire picture: The never-endingly long spaceship that just keeps on passing by at the beginning, and the "One Froggy Evening" / Looney Tunes reference during the ALIEN parody. I believe I spent the rest of the time retching.You'd be better off watching your toenails grow than punishing yourself by sitting through this mess.
sarcastic Everything is bad in this movie.....where should I start with?  1-EXTREMLY LONG!...the "climax" of the movie is like a torture, a normal lenght will be 10 ro 15 minutes, but in this one is like 40-50!!! and all because the stupid Autobots dropped Sam 25km away from Optimus spare parts!! I mean....could they be more stupid?? They could have left him near, but NO, it was a battle field, and he was defenseless.  2-TOO MUCH COMEDY - Parents, twin robots, bumblebee,fat computer nerds, conspirancy crazy guy....little decepticons....dumb giant robots.....Its amazing but the list can go on and on!!...arrogant teacher from THE OFFICE....Totally stupid! And there wasnt a single fun joke or scene between all this characters, in fact their attempts were so lame it was pathetic.  3-SQUARED CHARACTERS - No need to explain, all characters are robots (including humans) all predictable, all cliche, all repetitive.  4-THE CONSPIRANCY WAKO GIVING ORDERS TO THE ARMY - WTF??? Since when a civilian gives orders to the armada for using a secret weapon???  5-THE FLASHBACK OF THE MACHINE - we can see how the old autobots were having their AA meetings, and lots of caveman around it..and it was all surrounded by mountains....turns out thats Egypt...ya...there are so many mountains on Egypt today.  I could keep forever, but I erased from my memory most of the stupidities I saw, this are the worst that cannot be removed, and will torture me for the rest of my life.
sarcastic No, wait, I'm being sarcastic. This is a great novelty gift for preschoolers. No, no, I meant for hip cynical adults. Yeah, that's it.
sarcastic This is good phone. It is a phone, not an operating control for the space shuttle.  the phone arrived in the appropriate cannister, but it seemed that it had been tampered with.  at least it appeared to have been glued together.  after one month of use the phone has come apart.  I believe this is a recycled phone and so I would not recommend that you buy from this company.    finally, the phone is quite flimsy, if you put in in your pocket it will crack, if you drop it, it will break.  love the epaper, disappointed with the fragility of the thing.  imagine you are in the thirld world (the phone is designed to sell in poor asian and african markets), you put together a month worth of savings to buy this phone.  then while carrying out your daily labors the phone cracks, which is very easy to do...can you imagine the heartbreak.    I will not rebuy this phone model, although I love MOTOROLA.  
sarcastic What can one possibly say that isn't self explanatory?  Just as it looks - Band-Aids that look like bacon. Cool enough in it's own right.  I've been sitting here just *waiting* to cut myself just so I can slap one of these bad boys on, to the envy of all friends and coworkers. There's no doubt that a slab of bacon will heal any wound.  Comes w/ "free toy" too - a tiny little piglet figurine. How demented is that.
sarcastic Bill O'Reilly joins the ranks of people like Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity with "Culture Warrior" in producing a work that huffs and puffs over an America that might only exist in their own minds and the minds of their devoted fans. So let's take "Culture Warrior" seriously for a moment and give O'Reilly the benefit of the doubt: America is currently engaged in a cultrural "war" between conservatives and liberals for the soul of America and the battleground is largely the media (of which O'Reilly is a part of) and anything else considered "popular culture." O'Reilly uses various examples including the opinions of Hollywood figures such as Susan Sarandon, Jay Leno and his favorite, David Letterman. Apparently O'Reilly believes these guys in conjunction with rap music, are a national threat. Like Pat Buchanan's "State Of Emergency," "Culture Warrior" feels more like the worries and observations of someone who is watching history pass by and would like to turn the clock back. O'Reilly caters to the fears and worries of the conservative right by assuring them that we're the "good guys" and that Iraq is a just war(of course Mr. O'Reilly has never served a day in combat or actually participated in an armed conflict). "Culture Warrior" is a surprisingly short book, composed of much material from "The O'Reilly Factor" TV show, so it's not a very serious study to begin with, not because of the length, but because of the detail and quality of the content. At times O'Reilly comes across as one of those old-fashioned preachers who see Satan everywhere and must cast him out of your living room and television set. He taps into typical conservative slogans by using terms like "we need to be warriors," "you gotta fight back," "Islamofascism." He rants and raves about the key points to outdo your "opponent" when debating a "Secular Progressive." Like Buchanan, O'Reilly is shouting for an America that is quickly fading into the past, if it has not already faded. I would think a "Culture Warrior" would realize that cultures change, evolve, for better or worse, nothing stays the same forever. Like Ann Coulter, much of O'Reilly's prose here caters more to the elites in America, with disturbing undertones in the descriptions of "lower class" America. Is Bill O'Reilly really the most qualified voice to critique the merits of Hip Hop music? And haven't we had this same old tired argument since the days of Elvis? "Culture Warrior" is a requiem, a requiem bathed in self-dillusion about a "culture" that probably never existed to begin with. "Culture Warrior" will most likely fade with time as well, and in the future I imagine students will be reading Noam Chomsky to a higher degree than they ever will read Bill O'Reilly.
sarcastic The writing gets worse in the Twilight saga.  It makes VC Andrews (if you are old enough to remember those books) read like high literary prose.  But what teenaged girl can resist this plot of an unearthly gorgeous vampire (who is also wildly rich) in love with a mortal girl dealing with high school?  Apparently not many.
sarcastic When I first saw this T-Shirt, I think I cried for at least an hour. It is possibly the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, and I've seen the sunrise at the Grand Canyon, so I know a thing or two about beautiful things. I bought myself three of this shirt, and one for all of my family members' and friends' upcoming birthdays. All I can say is, I plan on wearing this shirt everyday, alternating between the three and doing my laundry every week or so, so that I never have to wear another shirt ever again. I was referred to this shirt by an aqquaintance, who told me how many women he picked up at Peep's, the local biker bar, with it. I can't wait to get mine!
sarcastic Two design flaws render this otherwise fine remote too frustrating to use for controlling Blu-ray (and DVD) movies.  1. No backlight or glowing keys, so operation in the dark is difficult. This wouldn't be a big issue if the buttons were better laid out and had some clues by touch to clarify their functions. But this is a big issue because of flaw #2...  2. The giant Stop button is positioned between the Play and Pause buttons, and all three are the same large size and shape. It's also between the Skip Back and Skip Forward buttons, horizontally, putting it right in the middle of all the most-used buttons.  It takes an impressive level of ineptitude to design a remote like this. Years of R&D on DVD remotes have wisely made Stop buttons smaller than other buttons, and placed them out of the way. Sony seems to have ignored that wisdom. It's much too easy to inadvertently tap the PS3 remote's large, centrally positioned stop button.  And unlike most DVD players, the PS3 has no "Are you sure you want to stop the disc?" warning, for when you do.  So when you accidentally stop your movie (which you will), it's a long and irritating process to find your place again on a Blu-ray disc.  It can take 5 minutes, depending on how many notices, previews, commercials and animated menus you have to get through again (some of which you can't skip past). And then you have to find where you were, risking seeing images or chapter titles that give away things you really didn't want to know yet. All this wasted time can kill the flow of a movie.  Hopefully there's a better remote that works with the PS3... one that was designed by people who test their products in real-world circumstances.
sarcastic The quick version of this book: If you're pretty and pouty, you too can land yourself a gorgeous vampire boyfriend who will continuously save your a**.  Let's take our main character first - Bella Swann. Yet another heroine who doesn't know she's beautiful and describes herself as shy but never exhibits the trait. The book is told in first person, which is unfortunate, because that means the reader is at ground zero for all of her insipid thoughts. She moves in with her father in his small town and holds contempt for just about everyone she meets at school, even though all they are doing is being friendly and including her. Not that any of this matters to Bella once she spots beautiful Edward. The next 500 pages are filled with purple descriptions of his magnificence, of how she's not worthy, of how could this god-like/Adonis-like creature stoop to love her.  I'm going to try to condense my irritation with Bella into a series of points:     * She's ridiculously clumsy, which is meant to be a fault, is passed off as charming, but basically just gives her an asinine reason not to run so Edward can save her.     * She "falls in love" with Edward within weeks of knowing him, and after a couple hundred pages, if he even mentions leaving, she hyperventilates and acts like her world will freaking collapse. Stalking is illegal in all 50 states, Bella.     * Whenever Eddikens so much as barely brushes his lips with hers, she either tries to rip his clothes off (natural) or her heart stops beating and she passes out. The girl hit the floor so many times in this book she put Giles to shame.  Which brings me to Edward. Angsty telepathic vampire Edward. While we have very little clear idea what Bella looks like, we get to hear about Eddiken's gorgeous, transcendental face and body over and over and over again. He's impossibly frustrating because he's been crammed with so many character traits, depending entirely on what the author wants him to be like at the time. He calls himself a monster and thinks he should have died all those years ago, but then totally lords his awesomeness over the mundane humans. And he is awesome. Lest you forget it, he's even awesomer than the rest of his vampire family at everything.   But the worst part about Edward is how he treats Bella. He is initially attracted to her because her smell is particularly attractive to him (okay, I'll bite) and because he can't read her thoughts. (Trust me, Eddikens, I'm lookin' right at 'em, and there ain't nothin' up there worth wondering about.) He knows he's a danger to her (woe!) and tells her straight off that it's better if they not be around each other (sorrow!)...and then he proceeds to hang all over her! He berates himself once every few pages for putting her in danger but never has the guts to fix the matter because he "just can't stay away from her" and "[she's his] life now." *wretch*  The author's writing style is unimpressive. Not bad, per se, but it wasn't giving me anything new. It all felt rather generic. Her vampires weren't bad - the "ultimate predators" and all that - but they were slightly ruined by her reasoning of why vamps can't go out in the sun. It's not because they'll burn up and die - it's because they glitter. That's right - these are GlamRock!Vampires. I also can see how Bella never takes Edward seriously when he tells her he's dangerous and she shouldn't want to be cursed with vampirism. Honestly, the author never shows us anything negative about the condition. It's all quick reflexes, superiority and baseball games with the fam.  The plot is bogus. Four hundred pages of ill-conceived romance and then a quick 100 pages of worse-conceived conflict. The romance, to put it frankly, is a little disturbing in how it borders on the obsessive, especially on Bella's side because he's just so, so, so beautiful!  And that's what bothers me the most about this book and the message that it sends to all of its rabid readers: the importance of beauty. Not inner beauty, either. Edward and his wonderful vampire family (all of whom are good because they don't feed on humans) are described over and over again in all of their wonderful physical qualities. They're cardboard characters for us to admire. Bella, of course, doesn't think of herself as beautiful, but the fact that she has four other boys in addition to the vampire falling all over themselves to please her begs to differ. I was willing to forgive the beauty of the vampires as a trait they acquire when they're turned, but a few others turn up later that are described as "nondescript" and ordinary-looking. And of course, they turn out to be the bad guys. Really, Stephanie Meyer?  I'm not buying it.  Or your sequels for that matter.
sarcastic This is a great mask to strike fear into those around you - an essentiality for the every day rapist or mugger
sarcastic I need to start off by saying this stuff is amazing! When a person is first given the list of ingredients for haggis, the stomach may turn a little. Being an adventurous food taster, I had to try it. Popping the can the contents appear to be similar to dog food. Once you mash it up and heat it in the microwave, the haggis transforms into a bowl of steamy goodness. Who would've thought that a conglomeration of sheep's hearts, lungs, and liver mixed with oats could taste so good? I definitley didn't. I was pleasantly surprised how the flavors meld into such a magnificent dish. Anyone in the states who is turned of by either the ingredients or shipping cost, should reconsider and give this stuff a whirl. (especially if you enjoy beef liver or chicken livers) This product is worth the price. I will be picking up this stuff many more times.
sarcastic Wouldn't this be the greatest buy in the world?  I ordered one just to see what would happen and they told me that it shipped on 2/15/10.  After about a week I emailed them and they confirmed that the packed had shipped on the 15th.  Today 3/8 I received another email saying that it must have been lost in the mail and I got my refund. Idon't know what kind of a game they are playing, but there are no winner. I was really hoping that one out a thousand chances i would get the unit.  Wishful thinking. They still have 93 available.  Best of luck
sarcastic No way, Bra! Tim and Eric is a whack rip off of the Jim and Derrick show, fool. Let me break it down for you, yo. Jim and Derrick be hella tight , yo. And stuff. Like hot chicks and hella mad whacks! Suck, swallow, release! Beahhtch! I saw Derrick Whipple in da flesh at Turbo Fuel Skatepark in Frisco, yo. He was doing mad tricks and hos, yo. That skit with the bunny and the honey had me cryin', yo. Fools always be tryin to git out of payin up, you know, yo. Bra. Anyway, I gotta run dawgs. I gotta go smoke outta my new pipe I just got for my 13th birfday. Me and my boy, tony, are gonna head down to brown town and find some herb and rolos. Peace, bra. Oh no you didn't! ha ha! Peace. You just got reviewed!
sarcastic Worst book ever. It had all this suspense that led absolutely nowhere. So if you're looking for extreme disappointment, look no further, you can find it in this book.
sarcastic I watched this movie twice, trying each time to do so with an open mind and see what all the hype about this movie was about. And each time I failed. The characters are battery-operated stock characters lousily acted by good (or potentially good) actors. We have the strict and egotistical father, the pragmatic and kind mother who holds the family together, the angst-ridden adolescent played by someone aged 21 (as if any teen who reads Nietzsche wants to go into the air force), the boozing-womanizer-Brooklynite grandfather (a depiction of Norman Mailer?), the depressed, pseudo-intellectual uncle (who does not act or look depressed at all during the film) and the princess daughter who enters into a beauty pageant. What happens between the beginning and the end is scarcely relevant, much less interesting: Van breaks down. Grandpa dies (none too soon). Daughter makes fun of beauty pageant contestants by doing a strip tease to the tune of Rick James' "Superfreak." Une vraie piece de restistance. Ha, more like a piece de merde. Don't waste your money on this waste of talent.
sarcastic For my entire life I have had one major problem...  I cannot for the life of me answer the phone while on the sofa with a blanket.  How many times do I have to fall off the sofa trying before I just let the answering machine pick up.  Now with the Snuggie I can answer the phone while on the sofa watching TV at 1AM!  THANK YOU SNUGGIE FOR SAVING MY LIFE!!    Ok, in reality this thing is a piece of junk.  Much thinner than they make it sound, no closure for the back, and you look like a member of Heaven's Gate.  All they need to send with it is a bottle of Red Kool-Aid and you are set for your 100% authentic Cult experience!  This makes a good gag gift, but be sure to get it ANYWHERE but their website unless you want to get ripped off on shipping and want to wait 10 weeks to get it.  10 weeks is too long for me to miss my 1AM phone calls.
sarcastic While this is still a very good show, it's already come dangerously close to jumping the shark (jumping the Sook?), in just it's second season.  I wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars but that's not possible here. I just couldn't bring myself to give it four, so I went with three. For starters, the show has veered much too far off on a tangent concerning the Maenad Maryann, and many, many viewers have been frustrated by it. Too little time was spent on the vampires of Dallas, which I found to be far more interesting.  Too much attention was also spent on the Jason/Fellowship of the Sun arc, which was a deviation from the book series. All in all, there was too much "filler" to get to the good stuff. The penultimate episode (#11, "Frenzy") was a disconcerted illogical mess with few highlights, and the portrayal of the vampire Queen of Louisiana, despite Evan Rachel Ward's beauty, left much to be desired, for whatever reasons. I think Holly Valance, who played "Lola" in the (now regrettably defunct) Moonlight episode "B.C" would've worked out better. "Frenzy" is widely regarded as by far the worst episode of the series so far, for various reasons.  Still, inevitably, many characters have been been interestingly further fleshed out from the first season, adding depth to the series; notably, Eric, Pam, Sam, Jason, Tara and her mother, but mostly the effervescent Lafayette, played by the very talented Nelsan Ellis.  While many deviations from the books have been made, some good, some bad, the decision to keep the character of Lafayette alive was definitely a good move. We also get to see, briefly, the darker, more powerful side of Eric. Anna Paquin is playing the role she was born to play, she just shines in her role as Sookie, and all in all, the cast is amazing, despite some lapses in judgement this year from the writing staff.  
sarcastic This is, without a doubt, the best black shirt with an angry monochrome dragon perched on two natural pillars on a cliff that I have ever seen. I know that when I get married, this is the undershirt I'll wear. The amount of awesome displayed on your chest canvas while wearing this shirt, obviously a shirt given to man by Zeus himself, is currently impossible to calculate using our current mathematical constructs. We actually need to devise a new form of mathematics which we should call Wurm Theory in order to parse the data. 	 I'm going to explain to you what it's like wearing this shirt. Each separate occasion merits a new stage of awesomeness being unlocked. 	 First wearing - You hear Sean Connery's voice command you to be the greatest. Whether you want to or not, while this shirt is on your back you will comply.  Second wearing - The best theme song of all time is instantly created for you and sung by the dragon on your shirt which, contrary to what you would assume, has an awe-inspiring singing voice.  Third wearing - You ascend to a higher level of consciousness.  Fourth wearing - The "what came first, the chicken or the egg" riddle is conclusively solved.  Fifth wearing - Zeus reveals his master plan and the meaning of life.  Sixth wearing - You get like, $0.20 off all your Starbucks purchases, and some places even let you take the cup you used the day before and knock an additional $0.05 if you use that. 	 PROS: Dragon on your shirt, Sean Connery finally gets some steady work again CONS: Some of the independently-owned Starbucks don't let you do the used cup thing.
sarcastic What an awesome idea for a childs toy. I bought one for my niece, wanting to instill the proper values in her starting at a young age. This baby doesn't cry, doesn't eat. All it wants is a smoke. And what's wrong with that? By the time I get home from another hellish day at the office that's all I want. Why not start early and learn those addictive coping habits before they get old enough to rebel. Now, if the company can just come out with one more baby. The others are coke baby, this one comes with a straw and a mirror. Heroin baby, comes with it's own set of syringes. And of course weed baby that comes with a huge blunt. The only one we're missing is crack/meth baby that comes with it's own pipes and is missing half it's head and an eye. Now THAT is one toy my niece cannot go without. Anyway....the smoking baby is fun, educational, and a must have. And in case you really are that stupid, yes this review is a joke. Lighten up. Or in this case....light up. :)
sarcastic Wow is this thing great!  I use it as a "mini-bar" when the friends and I go out to the bars.  I can quickly fix multiple shots of tequila for myself and the friends as we drive from one bar to the next.  We also discovered that if you place a pillow on top of it and turn on the cruise control you can catch quick naps on the interstate.  If you swerve to the left or right the rumble strips on the road wake you up in plenty of time before you get into trouble.  I can now take longer trips without being tired!  Also, i am now dating a midget and she fits nicely on the steering wheel desk which allows us to experiment sexually while driving.  This thing is like WD-40 or duct tape, it is a million and one uses!
sarcastic I bought this camera for my deployment to Iraq.  It was in my cargo pants pocket one day I took it out and the lens was cracked and the silver trim ring had fallen off.  I don't know how it broke but it did.  Anyways when I got home I contacted Kodak to fix it.  They said "Customer induced damage to the camera voids the warranty" they want $63 + $10.95 + tax to fix it OR I can send it to them and they will take 15% off a new camera if bought from the Kodak store.  No thanks, first and last time I'll buy a Kodak camera.  It's going to be a nice paperweight.
sarcastic Awkward sentences, conspiratorial, deluded and poorly developed, a patronisingly didactic tone and poor character development. Those are just a few of its virtues or flaws depending whether you have the fortune of literacy and the gift of sight or the gift of hearing should you decide to have this masterpiece read to you.  I recommend this to the homeless, it'll inspire jealousy when they realise there's a market for conspiracy, and to the people I don't like.
sarcastic I bought this helmet to use for a second rider on my motorcycle. It's only good for that if you don't like your rider. It is not very well made, it runs small and the shell feels like it would crack if you dropped it. Didn't give me a whole lot of confidence that it would protect someones head in an accident. But considering the price, I guess you really can't expect to much.  I would only recommend you use this helmet if you are riding a scooter or moped that doesn't get up to highway speeds.
sarcastic I had high hopes for this book, if for nothing else, then as a chuckle-inducing bathroom read.   I must say, I was gravely disappointed. The book literally did not elicit a single laugh from me, and most of the "suggestions" would only lead to you quickly becoming the supreme village idiot. The only reason I read the entire book was because I just had to know HOW bad this book could get. Quite bad, indeed, it reminds of a train wreck: so bad you just can't look away.   Now, I consider my self to have quite the sense of humor, yet this book just did not deliver on any level. If you consider yourself levelheaded, I'm sure you will agree.   If you want to read some real good chaff, go ahead and get this book. My copy is in the trash. I'm ashamed to have owned it.
sarcastic I've read several reviews from people who have wished that their Three Wolf Moon shirts had more wolves. It makes sense, right? The more wolves, the better. Yeah, and why don't you paint more angels on The Sistene Chapel, and correct the Mona Lisa's smile? While you're at it, maybe you could add a few tracks to Sgt. Pepper, and make the Great Wall even greater by adding a Starbucks and a Cinnabon. People, it's not like some art school dropout with an airbrush just pulled this design out of his . . . bag of tricks. No. There are three wolves and one moon for a reason.  Don't believe me? Let this be a cautionary tale. Two months ago I had the guy at Shirts Ahoy at the mall press on eleven more wolves. (Two more above the moon; one on each sleeve; six on the back, all howling.) Walking out of the store, I could feel the heat from my freshly pressed wolves, and I figured I was about to have the best day of my life and I should probably buy a lottery ticket. But my first hint that something was not quite right was when I passed three girls in skirts standing in front of Urban Outfitters, and I did not hear the familiar, gentle thud of panties hitting the floor. I figured they must be lesbians and continued to the parking lot. Driving to work, I observed that the other vehicles didn't move out of the way for me, and lights did not automatically turn green as I approached. Very strange. When I got to work, there was actually a pile of unpleasant paperwork where there is normally a giant pile of cash. As I sat at my desk, I began to get a headache and feel hunger, something that hadn't happened to me since I first donned the TWM. I asked a female coworker to help me peel off the eleven new wolves, but she refused and said she was taking back her recent offer to fulfill my every fantasy. So I did it myself. First I removed the six on back, then the two on the sleeves, then I put the shirt back on and removed the three above the moon. When I peeled off the final wolf, the coworker came back in, replaced my paperwork with a Wii, and told me she was reinstating her offer. I then heard a very familiar, gentle thud.  I may not understand the power of the lupine trinity. But hell, I don't understand electricity, or why the sky is blue. But I don't need to understand it; I only need to respect it. I will never mess with my TWM shirt again. I'm even careful when I bend over so I don't add an extra moon, if you know what I mean.
sarcastic As a history teacher at a high school full of unruly teenaged cretins, I am a firm believer of corporal punishment.  My classes are full of idiotic punks that would constantly interrupt my compelling lectures.  They'd shoot spitballs at me while I was expounding upon the Japanese Genpei Wars.  They would make rude comments about my weight while I was clarifying the complexities of the German Revolutions of 1848.  They would even post flyers that said "Mr. Anderson is a fat fairy" all around the campus.  Enough was enough!  Back when I was wielding an ordinary wooden ruler, I would only get laughed at.  I needed something that was capable of inflicting maximum damage.  Now that I'm swinging this beast, my class has been the perfect example of decorum.  Even the star quarterback of the football team quavers when threatened by this ruler's serrated edges.  Look who's laughing now, slackers!  --UPDATE-- Unfortunately I have been fired for the use of corporal punishment in my classrooms and am now working at a local Arby's.  I suggest only using this ruler for tearing paper...not students.
sarcastic This is a fitness system. Who needs fitness systems the most? Heavy people.   Guess what? I got on the balance board to be weighed and it told me I was too heavy to use it. Mind you I am not a "Biggest Loser" Candidate. I am just over the 250 lb limit.   Why would you build this without making it capable of working for bigger people? These are the people who want to lose weight in the privacy of their homes, until they are gym ready.   Completely stupid, upsetting, annoying and unfair. Wasted money.
sarcastic This is a very clever book on developing speed reading.  The author disguised it as a nonfiction account of the "liberal" news media, but as I discovered, if you only read the pages in which the author provides verifiable facts to support his reasoning, then you can finish the book before moving from the library book shelf.  Imagine, two hundred pages in five minutes!  I almost got finger blisters turning the pages so quickly. I learned years ago in college that when reading a non-fiction book, other than, let's say, most memoirs, that if the book is without reference materials, a bibliography, or notes that allows the reader to verify the information, then the book is most likely a sham.   "Bias" has zero references that would allow the curious reader to independently authenticate the writer's claims.  I also did not notice at least semi-complete transcripts to allow for the writer's alleged quotes to be understood in context.  The author is strictly operating on a "trust me" basis.  If that's good enough for you, then I have a 70's VW to sell you (only driven once, really would I lie!).   Regardless of your political orientation, the author should desire an intelligent audience.  By stating his views as proven facts, the author violates the trust given by his audience to treat them with intellectual respect.  Another book, "What Liberal Media?  The Truth About Bias and the News" by Eric Alterman, actually considers the accusations of the Bias author and finds the claims lacking substance.  Sure, Alterman is a liberal, but he gives a full forty pages of references (roughly a fifth of the Bias book's total pages) to back up his claims, and to allow the reader to look for her/himself.  In sum, if you want to know who is "Biased" consider who is preferring to hide the information vs. who gives it to you to make up your own mind.  I don't have to agree with all of Alterman's conclusions, but at least he gives me the opportunity to judge the facts on my own.
sarcastic This is pure hardcore punk people. This is the type of stuff that your parents can't listen to because it's too xtreme for them to handle. Not only is this hardcore anti-mainstream punk rock, it also has some of the greatest instrument work evar. I think only Kurt Cobain and Avril Lavigne can play guitar better than these guys. People bring names of unknown posers like John Petrucci, Jason Becker, Michael Romeo and Al di Meola, but fact is they suck because I've never heard of them (because they don't play their songs on TRL. That means they are a load of ass). The bass player is equally amazing, showing losers like Victor Wooten, Tony Levin, John Myung etc how to actually play the bass. And the drumming!! this guy is brilliant, and I don't mean like the so-called "brilliant drumming" of poser losers  like Donati or Portnoy or Cobham or any of those losers. I mean REAL talent. And where do you find talent? MTV and TRL of course!! this rocks almost as much as Ashlee Simpson
sarcastic What staggering chain reaction of catastrophes allowed Ann Coulter to command a pencil?   Clearly, an ego as huge and wantonly abrasive as hers belongs on daytime TV or talk radio.  She's ignorant, arrogant, and utterly vicious.  It hurts the conservatives to have someone like this on their side.  This book should have been called "Who Needs Facts?"  There isn't a single fact in this book.  I repeat, NOT ONE SINGLE FACT.  Coming up with moderately clever ways of stretching any viewpoint other than her own into an artless caricature of itself, then smugly and ruthlessly slamming everyone who holds that viewpoint, is much more fun (and more satisfying) than doing research.  Coulter doesn't need facts.  After all, if anyone asks her why liberals are evil, she can just tell them it's because God said so.  Let me assert that I am not a liberal only here to take potshots at a well-known conservative.  I am in the middle of the political road.  My view is that both extremes are usually wrong.  As an example, one of the guys in my workplace is the stereotypical angry young liberal: loud, opinionated, arrogant, abrasive, and ready to lay every problem in the civilized world at the feet of our current conservative President, GW Bush.  Obviously, there are things wrong out there that have nothing to do with President Bush, but you just can't tell this guy that.  As far as he's concerned, conservatives have ruined this country.  Ann Coulter is the same thing only backwards.  She would have you believe all liberals are boorish, unshaven, tree-hugging hooligans. They bathe in the blood of murdered babies. They want everyone else to have to bathe in the blood of murdered babies. They only stop short of international terrorism because they lack the ability to organize.  You think I'm exaggerating?  I'm not.  Coulter says things about liberals that I wouldn't say about Nazis (a group which, incidentally, she compares liberals to in several places).  This book entwines ignorance, invective, and outright fabrication into a wretched, half-congealed mess, and then presents it as "the truth".  It's not her ignorance that offends me.  It's her smug sense of superiority I can't stand.  I read a lot: I've got three large bookcases, all full, and this is the worst excuse for a book I can remember ever reading.    If you: are a hardcore conservative; are a hardcore Christian; are a fan of opinion in its most distilled and rarefied form; have a room-temperature IQ;  then this is your book.    Everyone else, stay away.
sarcastic If you are considering getting this trimmer, all you need to know is this: The 9 lockable length settings don't actually lock!! I tried putting it on length "3", but when I started to trim, it went down to length "2".  Then I started on length 2 and it went down to length 1.  Besides this, the cutting block is too far away from the thing that touches your face (not sure what it's called), so it's very hard to cut any hair at all unless you choose the length setting 3 or lower.  I know all this may come as a surprise to those of you who have had success with previous Norelco trimmers, but the fact is that this thing is a serious piece of Sh_t.  In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy "vacuum effect" has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY!  I would have given this 0 stars if it would have been an option.
sarcastic Certain words from various sources have been quoted, describing Justin Cronin's The Passage as "gripping", "intense" and "epic". I guess The Passage is considered to be an epic, because it clocks in at close to 800 pages. But by the time I finished reading, I felt this was an epic fail of massive proportions, and unless another book comes along this year, The Passage will be my most disappointing and worst read book. The hype is not always correct, even when a well-known respected author supports a book in such a way where you must have it as soon as you can.  The Passage begins in the not so distant future, around the year 2014. The first paragraph is somewhat poetic and confusing, where you have to read it a few times to digest it; much like the majority of this book: "Before she became the Girl from Nowhere- the One Who Walked In, the first and Last and Only, who lives a thousand years- she was just a little girl in Iowa, named Amy."  Amy's mother, Jeanette, gave birth to Amy when she was only nineteen, impregnated by a married traveling salesman. Jeanette ends up becoming a prostitute. One night her latest John won't take no for an answer, and she kills him. Jeanette has no choice but to give up her six-year-old daughter and leaves Amy at a covenant. The nun who takes in Amy is a young black woman, Sister Lacey, who believes God sent Amy to her for a reason. Lacey has been having disturbing dreams. But this is nothing new since Lacey has been a little girl, she has always known, understood, because THE VOICE speaks to her. Lacey knows Amy will bring forth a new way of life on Earth. How does she know this? Because it's stated without any real reason given.  Around the same time Amy is abandoned by her mother and thought of the second coming of who knows what by Sister Lacey, Special Agent Brad Wolgast and his partner have criss-crossed all over the Unites States to pick up a select group of inmates to be experimented on by the government. This has come about because Harvard professor, Jonas Lear, has gone into the wilds of the Bolivian jungle along with a group of scientist and grad students on behalf of the USMRIID (United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases). Less than a month in, Lear has grave news. Through emails with one of his Harvard associates, he tells about an attack by bloodthirsty bats, causing death and sickness in his group. He and the victims are eventually rescued by the US military. Wolgast figures out pretty quickly why twelve special inmates have been chosen. They are being infected purposely with the bat virus founded by Lear. But when Wolgast's boss orders him to pick up Amy for testing, that is when Wolgast knows something more sinister is at play.  For some reason Amy is the key to this all. Again, no reason is given and should only be taken at face value. Wolgast will put his life in danger to save Amy. But by then it's too late. Wolgast and Amy are able to escape, but those twelve inmates have transformed into "virals", bloodthirsty, hiding in trees, almost zombie like creatures who crave blood. And from some mind hypnosis and hallucinations through dreams, they can control humans and are able to make their way out into the world.  Wolgast and Amy hide in the mountains. From very limited newspaper reports, he reads about the downfall of civilization and how the virals are infecting and multiplying. Amy has changed. She can no longer stand sunlight and doesn't seem to age, but hasn't crossed over as a viral for some reason. Again, no explanation why. There is one last resort by the US government to stop the viral apocalypse. An atomic bomb is dropped.  Ninety-two years after the virals have wreaked havoc on the Unites States, (there's no knowledge of how the other European countries have faired because all communication has ceased) the remaining humans, who were mainly children rounded up by the US military, have carved a life out for themselves. These closed off communities in the mid central United States have found a way to carry on. The virals only come out at night and attack, so the humans armed with their bow and arrows, and protective high protective fences, keep these creatures at bay. There is a select colony mentioned in the San Jacinto Mountains near California to show this perfectly. But lately everyone is on edge. Their source of electricity is running out and the virals are evolving. And then a young girl comes out of nowhere who some have dreamt of. She is Amy, the ageless, and the only one who can destroy the virals. The people of the First Colony must travel back to where it all began and bring Amy to the one who calls for her.  The first section of The Passage will grab hold and not let up. Cronin sets into motion a tension filled tale that you assume will have you shaking in fear. Unfortunately, due to very long winded paragraphs and so much information being handed out, without any explanation, The Passage is more of a mind numbing vision quest with heavy, almost in your face religious and spiritual mentions. I was so bogged down with so much telling and not enough showing. The majority of the time I was very confused. Cronin doesn't give any plausible reasons, and we are just supposed to take it as fact and move on.  Most of the characters appear, where we are privy to their backgrounds, much like a biography, and then they disappear, only to re-appear again and bring nothing more to the story. This happens way too often. I couldn't connect with anyone, not even Amy. I felt very much like an outsider as I read. The virals, that should be scary boogieman type creatures, were glazed over in such a way that when they barely come out from the shadows they are hiding in to cause shock and horror, were incredibly tame and dull if anything.   The overuse of the two words, "I am" became beyond tedious. Talk about a mantra that will give you a headache. Perhaps the title should have been I Am instead of The Passage? Amy can hear the virals' thoughts, as I am John, Dick, Harry... I am the former Walrus, goo goo ga joob.   I wasn't gripped, amazed or enthralled in any way. I felt like I was reading one of those literary journals I used for research back in college. 300 pages could have been eliminated easily to make it a much tighter read. In essence, the idea of a new spin on a vampire apocalypse sounds perfect, but the way Cronin wrote it, he has missed the mark big time. The Passage will no doubt become a best seller and will prove that a very lacking book can become an overnight sensation based on amazing hype, the support of much respected industry types, and an expensive marketing and promotion plan from the publisher.

sarcastic Seldom a product comes around that arouses the senses in the way Tim and Eric Awesome Show: Great Job! does. When enjoying the show with my many coworkers and pets, I can't help but remember the great summer of 1993. For me, and many others, this is a return to the boldness yesteryear. It is a series that presents as many questions as it offers answers, sharing the joys of shrimp, sports and Bluetooth(tm) Technology with hundreds of millions of people across the globe.  Are Tim and Eric guide you like a Euchaetes egle? Maybe not. Could Richard Dunn be the next Dick Van Dyke? Perhaps on a perchance. Does David Liebe Heart tear at your heartstrings every time he opens his beautifully shaped mouth? A thousand times, yes.  Truly this 5-star cast will have you laughing as well as thinking within the first opening. Combine this with hundreds of celebrity guest appearances ranging from Oscar-winning Billy Crystals to music superstar DJ Douggpound and the viewer will have a euphoric experience presented in Digital Video Disk quality.   
sarcastic Can't power on. Freezed at beginning. Computer can't recognize it any more. Recorded voice is very low. If you buy it, prepare to throw it soon.
sarcastic It's been a year so I'm fuzzy on some details of the &quot;plot&quot; but I vividly remember how awful this was, even embarrassing to watch. I know very little about physics but I knew the &quot;science&quot; was bogus.  More problems: 1. Drunk Russian stereotype - yeah, he's smart enough to be  an astronaut but even their scientists are vodka-swilling boozehounds. 2.  Willis chases Affleck with shotgun after finding B.A. in bed with L.Tyler;  so unfunny and another movie cliche 3. Fire on asteroid? No oxygen for it  to burn. 4. No bomb can blow up asteroid that big 5. They become astronauts  after a few weeks training. 6. Bruce Willis' presence. 7. Yet more  stereotypes: Fat guy, big black guy, goofy yet smart little guy, etc. You  know the routine.  8. NASA people incompetent; stand around and let an oil  driller run show. 9. Love scene between LT and BA 10.Aerosmith soundtrack.  Don't always dislike them, but these songs were crappy. 11....ad infinitum:  The bad science I mentioned earlier. I wish a real asteroid had hit the set  when they were shooting this.  Absolutely horrific. Appalling. I was so  embarrassed to be watching this movie.  Please, spare yourself the torture.
sarcastic I have to admit that i have never laughed that hard after seeing a movie then i did when i saw this one. I was laughing out loud because this film reminded me of the crap my proffesors used to make the class watch on "the evil of america" and "taking down greed". Such comical propoganda devices that resembled those used in the 1950s, only instead of targeting communism they target american business. The lies in this film were so blatant that i felt like i was watching MSNBC or Fox. As a third generation cuban, my great grandmother was cubano, it was rather insulting to show cuba as this garden of eden for equality and freedom.But i eventually got over this because you cant let blatant lies and propoganda get you down otherwise the bullies in our culture like Mr. Moore win. If there is anyone that actually believes that Cuba has an admirable, free, health care system let me state some facts gathered from actuall cuban doctors and patients who managed to escape.   -IF there is a complication with the fetus of a pregnant woman the government forces an abortion. -If a child dies soon after birth the doctor will not record it as ever having lived at all (remember when moore stated that cuba enjoys a lower infant mortality rate? well there you go. thats the reason.) -That UN survey that states cuba as having a better health care system than us is on the survey, however the UN does not investigate countrie's health care systems, they simply take down whatever the country decides to report. Hmmmm....why should we believe what a communist dictator has to say about his own country? -Smuggled pictures show dilapidated hospitals, patients who are dying of starvation, neglect, and infection.   Those people that Moore shows in his film that have the high medical bills, you know the ones that are the helpless victims of our "disgusting, greed driven society". You will notice that all the people are middle class individuals with big screen tvs, 3 cars in the driveway, and an outstanding mortgage for a house that they cannot afford. Hmmmmm.....and im supposed to feel sorry for their utter stupidity and lack of regard for their own responsibility? Why is it that in this country people will pay $6 for a cup of coffee, and $50 for a videogame, but when it comes to their healthcare its simply "too expensive" and somehow the fault of "greedy businessmen". Maybe Moore should make a film about prioritization in america. About those people that throw their money away on material possessions but when their bills finally catch up with them they declare bankruptcy. It is trully a unique society we live in. their is such an utter disregard for responsibility and so many avenues and entitlement programs to cover your ass with.
sarcastic Hopefully you were smarter than me and read reviews before you bought this overpriced product. Put it this way. The instructions say "if you use a treatment wait 2 weeks before attempting another treatment" Well, after 2 treatments over 1 month didn't work for me I tried 3 treatment in 10 minutes, and each treatment was 10-20seconds over the recommended application time. Guess what happened? well, it is 2 weeks later, and the wart on my finger has doubled in size.  i have seen positive feedback on this product and i'm curious if they bought it when it was a very very small wart or a d-bag share holder/company man. 
sarcastic A nice printer rendered nearly useless by 2 reasons (so far) to hate this thing, had it about 2 weeks. #1: snatches paper like a starving man grabbing bread. Has snarled EVERY sheet of glossy brochure paper I've fed it! #2: Who wrote the software, a pinhead? If you remove a paper jam (see #1), or even do something as simple as replacing a cartridge, it signals "no paper fed" and then you have to print whatever it wanted like it or not, or fight with it by unplugging, turning off & on, turning pc off & back on, etc. etc. and it still doesn't always reset. I am just about to throw it through the wall! Update: two weeks later, after two printers and over 2 hours on the phone just now with amazon & hp, I can guarantee you I will never buy another HP product. Never. Ever.
sarcastic The "Hardest Thing" I've ever had to do Is listen to this cd, February 28, 2005 Recently I had the misfortune to be given this cd by a homeless man. I was coming home from my job at the paper clip factory, where I put paper clips into cardboard boxes, when I passed a man asking for spare change. I apologized because I had none to give him, and he handed me this cd. "Take this," he said in his grizzled wino voice. "I tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it."  So I brought the disc home and put it into my cd player while I was cooking dinner for myself and my seventeen dogs and also my latest mistress, Angela Adams. I wish I had not put it in the cd player, because the music that came out was really not that good.  Imagine if the Backstreet Boys met O-Town for dinner, and the four least talented decided to step into the alleyway beside the restaurant for a few minutes and began to scat. N'Sync hears the racket and pops in to see if their services are needed, but Nick Lachey steps forward and says, "No, N'Sync! Go away! We don't want any danceable beats or r&b flava in our music!" So Justin Timberlake and crew slink back into the empty garage next door to practice their moonwalks.  Not only is the 98 Degrees music boring, but an examination of the cd itself reveals more issues.  1. The font which is used to write the words "And Rising" is an unfortunate choice. The components of the "d" in "and" are not joined as tightly as they might be, so the "d" looks like an "al." This changes the name of the album significantly.  2. The boys are standing in front of a wall of fire, which I assume is supposed to be a reference to their name, 98 Degrees, which is a warm temperature. However, any idiot knows that fire is much hotter than 98 Degrees. Human beings are hotter than 98 Degrees, usually by about .6 degrees, and they BURN when put into fire. In fact, 98 Degrees the temperature is not that hot, just like 98 Degrees the performing group.  3. Several of the members appear to have gotten tattoos of the band's name on their arms. How lame is that? Can you imagine if people in all bands did that? I bet Emma Bunton would feel really lame right now, what with the Spice Girls having broken up and become completely irrelevant to pop culture. What's that? 98 Degrees is no more? No one buys their music? Nick Lachey is best known as Mr. Jessica Simpson? Ha ha! Bet you're glad you got that tattoo now, sucker!  I recommend you not buy this cd. Buy anything else instead. I hear Britney Spears is genius.
sarcastic I understand setting. And build up. And suspense. So after reading 100  pages of this book, I didn't give it too much thought that nothing had happened. Here is my report of what happened after that:  200 pages: Nothing has happened.  300 pages: Nothing has happened.   350 pages: Nothing has happened.  400 pages: NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.  Are you Kidding me?  Wait. WAIT. On page 441, something happens. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. O my God, this is it. Something is really going to happen! I plodded through this padded wasteland and finally something is going to happen!  Oh. Wait. It's resolved by page 451.   I'm not making this up.  So let me sum it up for you.   Bella falls for Edward because he is attractive (we are told he looks like an "angel" "is angelic" "is seraphic" and oh, again, "looks like an angel," on about pages 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 17, 20, 33, 34, 35, 40, 44 . . . you get the idea. I understand that "angel" might not be in a thesaurus, but FOR GODDSAKES, find a new description. Also, his hair is described, alternately, as auburn and bronze. Did anyone else have a problem with the fact that these are completely different colors? Seriously.  So Bella loves Edward for his looks. How precious.  Edward loves Bella for her smell.   What a beautiful, timeless romance.   Spare me.   Also, was anyone painfully unimpressed with the whole Alice side-story? Meyer obviously planted the hints about Alice's missing memory, only to explain it away later to *shock and surprise* us, with something completely uninteresting. It's like the saying goes: if you see a gun in chapter one, it's going to go off in chapter three. But if the gun goes off in chapter three during target practice and only manages to hit a tree branch, did it even NEED to be in chapter one in the first place? The Alice thing was pointless. Call me when you have a real twist.  I imagine this book is lovely for ambitious twelve year olds who want to tackle a five hundred page novel. They will find it easy to do so, because Twilight reads like a painfully long letter an immature but stuck-up pre-adolescent writes to her pen pal.   I am SO SAD this passes for good teenage fiction.  And this is why, when someone announces she writes Young Adult fiction, that people say, "Why don't you want to write real books?"  And that Sucks.
sarcastic My son talked me into reading these books with him, and we loved them.   When we went to see the new Harry Potter movie, scenes for it came on during the trailers.   He recognized the story the second the preview started.  He was thrilled, and so was I.  What potential this unique and fun series had for a movie--or movies...I mean, they advertised that it was being brought to us by the people who make the Harry Potter movies.    The Potter movies stay so true to the book--taking care to absolutely keep things in the screenplay that are necessary to the plot line.    I wish I could say the same for this movie.    When it finally came out, we went to a movie theater in NJ that was right across the river from NYC.   We could see the Empire State building from the theater parking lot, and took it as a sign that the movie was going to rock.  We were so psyched to see it.    When we left the theater, I thought my son was going to cry, and I couldn't un-scrunch my eyebrows--huh?? I felt so bad for him, for me, for Rick Riordan...    We understand that it's impossible to make a movie exactly like a book-- but this was a travesty.  Every important aspect of the story was by-passed for the sake of special effects.    It's almost as if the screenwriter had been given a verbal summary of what the book was about, and took it from there. So many important plot points were left out or down right changed to the point that it would be impossible to even think about a sequel.    It's such a shame.  These stories have the "book made to movie" potential of the Potter series, or dare I say, a kids "Lord of the Rings".    If someone with vision had just read the books, the money used to make it could have been so much better spent.    It could have been knocked out of the park, but, alas, the ball was dropped and we all lost.
sarcastic I am now waiting on my second seat and car seat adaptor for months. I have written baby jogger 3 times now. They do not respond. This is just plain ridiculous. It now says on sites like Amazon that it will be late May before they ship. How can a company that ships baby products have such delays. By the time we get the car seat adaptor my daughter (already born last month) will no longer need it.
sarcastic Anyone whos truly knows muzak knows that Lindsay Lohan is one of the most talented young musakians in the world today. She has proved that many times. She also proved that she is one of the best guitarists every in the contempary cinema classic Freaky Friday. Have posers like Al Di Meola had their own movies where they document their so-called "great" guitar playing?? No. Do you know why? Because they suck. The Muzak on this album is some of the best ever. Lohan along with Avril Lavigne are the two best guitar players in the world. They are better than those "classical" posers who don't look cool at all. The drumming shows wannabees like Peart and Bruford how it should be done. The bass shows self-proclaimed bass "masters" like Stu Hamm that crappy "inversions" (I don't know what that means) and lame techniques like "tapping", "counterpoint" and "slap and pop" (I have no idea what these mean either) are just crap that losers with no talent do.  If you do not like this then you have bad taste.
sarcastic Maybe it's just me, but in about 1 or 2 months, the paint started coming off the joystick/pad with only the face of my thmb (no scratching).  Also, about a week later, It just stopped.  It died, no longer worked.  I took it apart and nothing was loose. I think the circuts got messed up.  Basically, if you are planning to do anything other than look at this gamepad, which isn't too pretty anway, don't purchase this (unless somebody pays you to do it)
sarcastic I am certain that there were a few people in the audience of this show who thought, "I could get up on stage and do what he's doing  if I had a full orchestra behind me." Guess what? They were probably right. Poor Rufus. His voice is very limited. It lacks power, strength, and is quite thin. It's not an attractive voice. As much as he strains (and strain he does), he simply can't sing this collection of standards with the expressiveness they are entitled to. He lacks the emotional depth (his between song anecdotes reveal him to be shallow and charmless. One anecdote has to do with him meeting the man who was the drummer who played in the original Judy Garland concert. Rufus' classy description of him: "he was old and smelly."). Whatever possessed him to go through with this mammoth vanity project? Perhaps the ghost of Judy Garland while she was on another pill and alcohol fueled lost weekend? I am amazed that anyone put up the money to produce this night of self-delusion and self-absorption. This is nothing but karaoke with an orchestra standing in place of the karaoke machine.  Ok, Rufus, the bar heard you sing once already. Shut up, sit down, and let someone else get a chance at the microphone. Why do I keep coming to this bar on karaoke night? Boy, do I have too much time on my hands. Hey, there's a cutie over there; I think I'll go over and say, "hello." Wait a minute! Who's singing now? Rufus again?! That's it, I'm outa here!
sarcastic That review above mine is just some crap written by some poser with no taste. 50 Cent is just as good as all those old "musicians" that you cherish. People give him crap because he can't read or write muzak. Even more people give him crap because he can't read or write. I've heard posers come out with garbage like "he merely exploits his image and shallow agenda because he wants money" and "his songs are retarded enough to allow him daily access to a wheelchair" etc etc etc. But I have one question for you. How many times have your precious "musicians" been shot? Everybody needs to remember that muzak quality (espeically in the case of rappers who the greatest musicians of them all) is based on the toughness. How many times has Beethoven been shot? Or Miles Davis? Or that poser with the violin? Exactly. Speaking of Beethoven, I don't know why people give him credit just because he made a bit of music when he was deaf. If you want a great musician with disabilities then go for 50 Cent.
sarcastic This item has wolves on it which makes it intrinsically sweet and worth 5 stars by itself, but once I tried it on, that's when the magic happened.  After checking to ensure that the shirt would properly cover my girth, I walked from my trailer to Wal-mart with the shirt on and was immediately approached by women.  The women knew from the wolves on my shirt that I, like a wolf, am a mysterious loner who knows how to 'howl at the moon' from time to time (if you catch my drift!).  The women that approached me wanted to know if I would be their boyfriend and/or give them money for something they called mehth. I told them no, because they didn't have enough teeth, and frankly a man with a wolf-shirt shouldn't settle for the first thing that comes to him.     I arrived at Wal-mart, mounted my courtesy-scooter (walking is such a drag!) sitting side saddle so that my wolves would show. While I was browsing tube socks, I could hear aroused asthmatic breathing behind me. I turned around to see a slightly sweaty dream in sweatpants and flip-flops standing there.  She told me she liked the wolves on my shirt, I told her I wanted to howl at her moon.  She offered me a swig from her mountain dew, and I drove my scooter, with her shuffling along side out the door and into the rest of our lives.  Thank you wolf shirt.   Pros: Fits my girthy frame, has wolves on it, attracts women Cons: Only 3 wolves (could probably use a few more on the 'guns'), cannot see wolves when sitting with arms crossed, wolves would have been better if they glowed in the dark.
sarcastic The Room is the greatest film ever produced.  Writer/director/producer/actor Tommy Wiseau is a jack of all trades visonary genius who could very well be the offspring of Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg.  Call him the Hitchcock of black comedy, the Orson Welles of symbolism, and the Martin Scorsese of sex scenes.  His foresight knows know limits.  He will plunder your heart and soul and leave you on the floor, breathless, panting for more of his vivid and penetrating mis-en-scene and astute aural pleasure enchanted with both harmony and discord.  You will call off work the next day.  You will find yourself living a life that cannot possibly be real.  You will begin questioning metaphysical reality as you find yourself trapped in a void of hate and condemnation.  Hate because you did not think of creating The Room first.  Condemnation as you relive your past failures.    But while The Room will have you calling into question the insane lament that you now find yourself dangling by, you will elope with your new lover and find solace in it's affair, it's tortuous ownership of your heart.  Such is the masochistic nature by which you must now live.  But do not fret!  You will worship The Room's takeover as a necessary love-hate balance which, in time, you will discover is truly a microcosm of the universe's chaotic beauty.  Embrace it, but never coddle it.  It is your new mistress.
sarcastic I am almost embarrassed to admit the lack of reviews regarding this particular piece of lost lore.  This protective article of clothing is much more than meets the eye.  Simple pixles from your computer screen couldn't possibly capture the majestic and unbridled power of this cloak.  There are *actual yeti hairs inscribed into each fiber of cotton.  Upon first donning this garment, all former vestiges of humanity are lost.  I was immediately transformed into a towering ogrillion figure, 12 feet at least, and began my rampage.  I hold no memories from this torrential act, however, the next day's paper gave insight to the destruction I, no doubt, wreaked.  The obituary section actually took up the entire contents of the paper, the Statesmen labeling this the worst case of killing-spree homicide the world has seen yet.  This is a definite must buy, considering the raw power of this more-than-celestial article.  Purchase this shirt today, and release the debiltating, dragging bonds of society.  Let go of your humanity and embrace the yeti.
sarcastic If you are looking for a really expensive paperweight, or need to replace the brick in your solid gold commode, the Archos is the device for you. However, if you are looking for any amount of *functionality*, there are volumes of viable choices that cost much less and actually work, such as any Android-based phone.      I have all sorts of Archos accessories that I can use with multiple stereos, televisions and computers and I've invested volumes of time now trying to get *any* combination of functionality that I can't get on something much cheaper -- like my netbook, or even my phone -- with little or no success.       To compare the application library that Archos provides [without using a hack another user has provided to access the Android Library] is like comparing the largest local mega-mall to a "7-11" corner store... assuming the corner store went bankrupt several years ago.      Alas, however, the hack only gets you past the software problems, and leaves you with the hardware and the firmware/operating system that Archos provides. The operating system is an Android variant, whose updates have only once removed my access to every other application [out of three total updates] which I applied at the recommendation of the Archos Customer support folks. And the hardware... well... once you get past the non-standard connectors for any of the other Archos accessories that don't connect quite correctly because of all the different variations between different Archos hardware components you can just bet that the documentation won't be able to help you troubleshoot any of the myriad of problems you are going to encounter on an on-going basis.      Fortunately, there is an on-line support forum for the dedicated, but for the *price* you pay, there are *much* better options available. If you are under the impression that the *form factor* will make it special, like I was... well good luck actually getting it to access anything, either on the internal hard drive [think reformatting, several times... maybe it will eventually work] or on your local network [I have no idea how a valid file that is stored on another machine that my Archos CAN see could be "corrupted", but I'm going research that the next time I have an hour or three to throw away...] or even from the directly-attached satellite receiver -- the codes provided by the documentation don't work, which I did not find even remotely surprising, but at least there's a trouble-shooting section that doesn't help...
sarcastic This book is psycho-babble at its worst. (Why five stars, then? Read on...) The king, for example, is "really" a penis, and therefore the whole game is "really" an attempt at castration, because both players attempt to mate the enemy king. Castling is protecting one's penis from the castrating father because it "hides away" the game's "penis". Riiiiiiiiight.  The queen's power, on the other hand, shows the mother's female power, and players who tend to swap queens early are afraid of women. Well, either that, or they are stronger in queenless positions because they are better in positional endgames than in tactical ones. And what about languages where the piece is not called a "queen" at all, such as Arabic or Hungarian? No matter--the very fact that it's *powerful* is enough for it to symbolize the power of women. Again, Riiiiiiiiiight.   Worse than such nonsense is Fine's buying of, apparently, every single tall tale of the "crazy chess player" kind and attributing the "real reasons" for the apocrypical story to deep-seated psychological problems. Hence Morphy's "fetishism" with women's shoes (never happened) or Alekhine's "throwing" a king across the room when he lost (ditto) "prove" their sexual masochism and/or sadism; etc., etc., etc.   The most puzzling part of the book is where Fine attribues deep, hidden psychological causes for *specific moves* masters made--of course, "proving" them all deranged in some way or another (all except himself, that is). A blunder is never a bluner, but only a result of a deep-seated, subconscious "masochistic" desire to be punished (by that standard, I am the worst masochist in the world...) A move that makes many threats isn't just a (usually) good move, it shows the deep-seated "agression" of the player, while a quiet winning move shows his "sadism". And so on and so forth.   This sort of thing would, perhaps, be understandable if the writer was ignorant about chess. After all, total ignorance of, say, politics or economics didn't stop psychoanalysts from "proving" what the "deep psychological reasons" for war or capitalism (or whatever) "really are". But Fine was a very strong player! He, of all people, should have known that chess masters do not think like that. Of course his excuse is the pychoanalyst's eternal excuse: you may not *think* you think like that, but that just proves you're "in denial" about the "deep subconscious roots" of your actions. On the other hand a total stranger, like Dr. Fine, from decades and continents away, can effortly tell us the "deep subconscious reasons" some master "really" made a certain move. How did Fine aquire this magical ability? From St. Freud, of course. For the third time: Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.  In short, this books does, indeed, show us something about the psychology of the chess player. It shows us just how confused and laughable an obviously intelligent man, and a very strong chess player to boot--Dr. Fine himself--could become once he fell into the silly dogmatic nonsense of Fruedian psychonalaysis.   I therefore recommend you go right out and get the book! You'll never find a better example of rip-roaringly unintentionally funny psycho-babble. No comedian had ever a parody of psychoanalysis to match what's inside this irredeemingly awful book. It is *so* bad, it's good! This is the "Plan Nine from Outer Space" of Psychology books.
sarcastic Having recently moved into an upscale manufactured housing facility thanks to the luck conveyed upon me by my Three Wolf Moon t-shirt, I stumbled upon the Zubaz pants here at Amazon and decided that these would complement the crisp, confident, and rugged image conveyed by the T-shirt.   Black Zebra naturally, as these are the sartorial equivalent of the red power tie or a navy blazer with bright buttons.  My buddy has an original pair that I always admired.   I should warn that in direct sunlight the high contrast pattern of these pants, if viewed directly, can cause dizziness and disorientation.  That's why I keep my Oakley Blades on a leash around my neck, just in case.  I had just returned to my humble abode from the pheresis donation center when the UPS driver pulled up with my package.  Realizing what was being delivered I grabbed the box, thanked the driver and mostly ran up the five steps to my double wide.  Hopping on one foot while trying to get my acid washed jeans over my boots, I simultaneously opened the box with what pass for my teeth.  As I pulled the silky polyester over my legs I was simultaneously struck by a sense of awe and wonder.  That's when I fell over and nearly knocked myself out on the rear projection television in the living room.  In hindsight I should have realized that this was the first sign of trouble.  After putting the pants on and admiring them for a few hours, I went down to the Wal-Mart to get some scratch and wins.  I went over to Arbys and smoked half a pack of Marlboro Light Menthols down to the filter while I went carefully through the lottery tickets, rubbing each one on the Moon for luck.  After 25 tickets, I hadn't even won $2!!!!!  Perhaps it was the nicotine, perhaps it was the sheer awesomeness of my attire which overwhelmed me, but I didn't realize that this was another sign that things were not altogether correct.   In the next 48 hours I misplaced my keys, lost my job at Waffle House, was rejected by four women I tried to pick up, chipped my remaining front tooth when I botched a flying roundhouse kick breaking up a fight at the roadhouse, and even spilled ketchup on my Three Wolf Moon t-shirt while eating a chili-dog.  To add insult to injury, someone keyed my Camaro.  Three days later I found myself face down in a puddle of my own sick, choking back the tears of a wasted youth.  I don't know how to explain it but the awesome factor of the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt is not in fact multiplied by the Zubaz pants.  It's like Cold Fusion - once you bring two multifarious confidence and testosterone factors into play, the inverse coalition of chronological extremes dipolarizes the original fulcrum.  That is to say, not only do they cancel each other out, you're screwed.  I've burned the pants, bought another Three Wolf Moon T-shirt and even tried the Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt.  Nothing has restored my Mojo.  Upon quiet reflection I've come to accept my fate.  Don't let this happen to you!   Now to settle back for a tall glass of  Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz   You might enjoy it's nourishing and self defense properties as described in my recent review....
sarcastic No one should buy this book until the guy owns up and says what guild he is in.  I could write a guide on how to fly a 747 but when you find out I only actually fly model planes, the perspective changes.
sarcastic 1.  An ice-age can take place in 16 days. 2.  An artic hurricane can freeze helicopter fuel instantly but has no effect on normal household gas. 3.  An experienced explorer can walk from Philadelphia to NYC in one day in the worst blizzard in history. 4.  The President of the US will stay in the White House until the very end to "stay with the sinking ship". 5.  Books being burnt look remarkably like wood being burnt and apparently last a long time. 6.  In a massive flood in NYC, unmanned oil tankers will be able to circumnavigate the flooded streets to arrive at the door of the public library.   I'm sure there was a lot more I could have learned, but I was laughing too hard.
sarcastic Ben Kingsley, you really must have needed the money. Natasha Hentsridge was cast solely for that gorgeous body of hers; the producers knew that they had a ridiculously bad film on their hands and had to give the target  audience some reason not to complain. But complain I will, because I want  something resembling a real plot in my sci-fi; I want stimulation for more  than just my groin; I want my sense of plausibility to be stretched, not  tossed aside. This film is a mish-mash of retread effects, no thrills  whatsoever and way too many, "Oh, we just missed her again by seconds,  so let's chase her some more!" Wretched, simply wretched. Species,  since it's release, has been the movie by which I judge all others - for  awfulness. Whenever I see a truly terrible sci-fi movie, the first thought  that comes to mind is, "Well, it was better than Species."
sarcastic It's obvious to me the positive reviews here come from White people fascinated with Asian culture (anything Asian must be exotic and intriguing).  Just look at the review entitled &quot;multicultural Braveheart with Kim Chi.&quot;  I don't see any reviews for Braveheart entitled &quot;multicultural First Emperor with Haggis.&quot;  There was no Kim Chi in this movie.  There was also no &quot;love&quot; here, either.  The movie had the potential to have a love triangle, but love was neither talked about nor seen.  The closest that came to &quot;love&quot; in the film was an obsessive-psychotic guy who threw a spear at anyone who dared come within a foot of the princess.  The princess was an annoying primadonna who wasn't worth anyone's time.  There was no character development, and there were too many fight sequences.  If you want to see a good Asian movie with a war epic and a real love triangle, see Hero.
sarcastic Well as if the Nineteenth Century weren't bad enough we now have Penguin shoving it down our maws every other day with another re-issue of some tepid &quot;classic.&quot; Miss Bronte has done it again and wielded her  magic pen as a wand and cast her net of sleep on the unsuspecting reading  public of America. The only consolation the non-preteen girl reader can get  form this sack of slumber is the final realisation that  &quot;wuthering&quot; is British slang for &quot;your eyelids are getting  heavy, why don't you just nod off?&quot; I really have to say to Miss  Bronte that I did not find Garfield's antics convincing in the least.
sarcastic If you're a fan of awkward pauses, weak plotlines, and shirtless guys, this movie is for you.  By the end of the movie, it seemed like there was a lot of suspense, but not the right kind of suspense.  I found myself with enough time between the character's lines to figure out what I'm doing for the rest of the week/month.  A lot of times the pauses in the dialog were filled by grunts, sighs, and heavy breathing, which is more than a little uncomfortable.  Also, I found myself wondering how two such awesome genre's as Vampires and Werewolves would get themselves wrapped up in something as lame as a highschooler with a breathing problem.  Do yourself a favor and rent/buy/obsess over something else.
sarcastic Good for basic rythmn, but you'll never hear these in a live setting, unless you mike them.  Be like Mick Jaggar and get the really big gord models or better yet, some plastic or rawhide model, or a cylindrical shaker, you can at least hear them in the live setting.
sarcastic But, why should you buy this T&EASGJS2DVD? Simple. Flexibility!  The DVD can double as: Constant Feelings of Inescapable sorrow Disenfranchisement from peers and social groups Pretending its all ok Forgetting to take your medicine Driving a car off a slick, iced bridge It looks like an accident Smoldering metal wreckage A solitary smile, finally at peace.  Great for Dads and Grads! Buy it! 
sarcastic If you enjoy repeated phrases (e.g., &quot;fountain in a Love-In-Tokyo&quot;), overused metaphors, and capitalized words in the Middle Of Sentences For Effect, then this is the book for you.  Otherwise, rest assured that the title really is the best part of the book.
sarcastic If The Jackson 5 were little white-hippies, moved from Gary, Indiana down to Tulsa Oklahoma, had at least 2 less talented brothers, a lot less soul; a little less style, exchanged their Afros for some new goldy-locks, and were able to move from 1964 to 1997 then they might be Hanson.  I love Hanson!!!  Their raw talent to age ratio is absolutely undeniable in everyway.  Anyone who denounces "MMMBop" is an absolute liar.  1997 didn't have the greatest music to offer anyway!  One word: CREED was huge!  Okay, that was 3 words, but anyway...  Hanson had more soul in 1997 than most R&B artists.  Come on, Hanson owned the Spice Girls! and everyone who ever bought Bop magazine knows that's true.  Note: I've never bought a Bop magazine, because its trash.  anyway... "Middle of Nowhere" is the best tasting bubble gum you've almost ever had.  You know you're chewing bubble gum, you know what that is but you still want some, and you just can't get enough!!!  [Middle of Nowhere yielded 5 hits: "MMMBop", "Where's the Love", "I Will Come to You", "Weird", and "Thinking of You".]  If you weren't tapping your toe to "MMMBop" in 1997 then you were in a coma, or you just weren't tapping your toe in 1997.  It's true and I can prove it.  In closing Hanson could never be as bada>> as The Jackson 5, Creed isn't as bad as I made them out to be (but almost), and you should consider not being all high and mighty and buy Hanson's 1997 smash "MIDDLE OF NOWHERE;" if you play it in the middle of nowhere, no-one will make fun of you!  You might also land a girl who was about 12 or 13 in 1997 and now desperate for love at 24 or 25, and that in and of itself is worth the $7.99 that Amazon is currently charging... If you want the original and greatest child-star debut album off all-time then buy, "Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5" it blows 99% of most modern music off the map.  MJ was BAD every since he was 9!!!  Sorry Taylor Hanson, you should have learned to moonwalk.
sarcastic Mom proudly displays Dad in this urn in her assisted living apartment.   After keeping Dad in a cardboard cylinder in the garage on the workbench near his tools, where he was most at home for a couple of years, Mom had to move to an assisted living facility. Since she talks to him every day, we had to prepare Dad for the move. He wasn't too happy about it, and he was pretty upset that we spent so much money for his new home, especially since the old one was free from the crematorium. He also wasn't too happy about being stuck in the same room with Mom all the time, because now he'd have to listen to her talking all day.   When I told him the urn was pretty soundproof, he said ok. So I poured him in. He just fit, but I spilled a little of him on the workbench.He was ok with that.   I guess we'll get the matching one for Mom when the time comes. Dad said to wait for a good sale, and be sure there's enough room for a phone so she won't nag him all day.   Dad, it's been almost 5 years, and I miss you like it was yesterday. Mom doesn't miss you so much. To her, you're still there.
sarcastic This was quite possibly the worst book I have ever read.  (Skimmed the last 50 pages hoping against hope to find something worth reading.  When the Library Journal review says "Not recommended," believe them!  I bought this from the $1 bin at a bookstore sale, and paid too much.  I was hoping to find a look into some of the inner workings of the FBI and some good stories.  Instead, I got a 210 page diatribe on how awful "that Clinton crowd" and "those Clinton people" were.  Aldrich chose the most unprofessional way possible for an "insider" to complain about the lack of professionalism of the Clinton administration.  (I did at least enjoy the irony - but not quite enough to give this piece of trash even one star.)  Whining about the Clinton's Christmas decorations?!!  He also makes it clear that he knew from day one that they were all going to be bad news because some of the men had earrings and pony tails!  And one woman dressed in all black and wore black fingernail polish, so he knew she was "unsuitable."  In this incredibly biased drivel, Aldrich manages to insult ALL Southerners, ALL liberals, ALL Democrats, ALL people in their 20's and 30's, ALL people who listen to rock music, and on and on and on.  He clearly believe that all people are homogeneous within groups that he can readily identify instantly by a few characteristics.  And he makes it clear that ALL Clinton administration people were horrible people, criminals, liars, drug users (and dealers).  If you see this piece of garbage in the $1 bin, save your money!  I give this 0 stars.  The site requires at least one star, but I would give it 0.
sarcastic This tank is great for clearing out the undead. Class 3 outbreak? Zombies around every corner? No problem if you have this tank. With its confortable passanger space and great sniper area on the roof, you will be ready to take down a mob of flesh-starved zombies. If you order the gps link-up with the official Badonkadonk Ion Cannon in orbit, you might even clear the infected area all by yourself (service is extra. $19.99 customer service on the Ion Cannon.) Killer sound, too, so that you can rekill to your favorite music. It has a loudspeaker outside so that the enemy can die to the sound of great music (and not each other's moans.) Overall its a very good tank. But the color selection could be better...   Also works great against your local terrorist organizations, nazi meetings, and communists.
sarcastic As was the case with quite a few other readers, I had been snookered into believing this was a near-universally lauded classic.  Hello?  The emperor has no clothes and this book has no redeeming qualities.  The writing style was absolutely maddening!    The only reason I read the entire thing was because I purchased the book and felt compelled to get my money's worth (not entirely possible with such a low quality "classic")  After reading it in its entirety, I felt the type of satisfaction one feels after completing a particularly odious chore.  Removing my copy from my home will be most satisfying.  Bottom line:  Boooooooooooooring!
sarcastic Oh em gee!  This is like the most bomb diggity fantastic album ever.  I want to permanently attach my earphones to my ear and blast Adam's music into my brain.  He is God.  I would do anything for this man.  I would even file my taxes on time if he asked me to.  I luv internet privacy.  Don't you?
sarcastic Please don't even bother watching the first 3 season's of this series because watching the 6th season is like watching a totally deferent show. Nothing is cohesive and if your an actual fan of the core 5 characters don't even bother because theirs hardly any interaction between them. I remember watching the pilot of this show and thinking it had some potential to be great especially with the whole relationship with Dan, Lucas, and Nathan. Six episodes into season 1 I was hooked, everything was so realistic fun and new. I actually found characters that I loved and rooted for and character developement was at all time high. Two seasons later I would never have thought I would stop watching, all the character developement that was built during season 2 & 3 was shot to hell with season 4. Characters & storylines turned OOC and god awful. I thought season 4 was the worse but I still had hope for the new seasons. HAHAH big mistake, season 6 has taken the cake and I have to say I blame the writing. I mean come on how many times do I have to watch Peyton near death, I seriously could care less how a totally unrealistic character can be thrown into life and death situations just to see her cry 85% of the season. And Dan, jesus can the guy die already, he has been poisened, hit by a car, tortured by a pschotic nanny (lmfao yes that actually did happen), oh and let me not forget he needs a heart transplant. He was close to getting one but nah a dog seemed to come across his new heart and got hungry and ate it, WTF! It's so sad that this show has come to a dog eating a friggen heart to entertain people. No wonder the ratings fell from a 3.3 to a 2.8. I say season 6 is just a cheap imatation of a daytime SOAP, really the two most annoying emo twin couple is having trouble with their pregnancy - SHOCKER! oh c'mon will the writers try to be a bit more creative. It's already been said that Lucas & Peyton is one of the worse/awkward couples together so get over it and stop trying to get people to feel sorry for them. I don't even want to get started on the useless side characters hogging up the screen. Season 6 is just awful and worse season to date, the creator should just jump off a cliff because his show is DEAD.
sarcastic WHENEVER I ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE CAPS LOCK KEY IN THE PAST, A LITTLE LIGHT WOULD COME ON. LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT LIGHT WAS JESUS TRYING TO GET AT MY BRAIN. BUT ONCE I LET HIM IN AND BURNED ALL MY BOOKS AND CONDOMS, I REALIZED THAT THE ONLY CHRISTIAN WAY TO WRITE IS IN ALL CAPS. OTHERWISE THE HOLY SPIRIT WON'T GET ACROSS TO ANYBODY!  THIS IS A FANTASTIC BOOK BUT MY BOOKSHELF IS A BIT SPARSE AS AFTER READING IT I BURNED ALL MY OTHER BOOKS, INCLUDING THE BIBLES AS THEY WERE WRITTEN PARTIALLY IN LOWERCASE LETTERS, OR AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM, THE DEVIL'S RUNES. CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND ME A GOOD ALLCAPS BIBLE?
sarcastic ...if you're an aspiring writer in need of a primer that gives never-ending examples of what NOT TO DO.  I'm working on a teen fantasy novel of my own, and Meyers' Twilight series never fails to remind me of the things I want to completely avoid in my own writing.  Let's consult the list, shall we?  1) THE BORING SUE HERIONE.  You may have heard of the Mary Sue, the perfect female protagonist who can do no wrong, who has unnatural beauty, who is beloved by all; Bella isn't quite a Mary Sue.  She's described (by herself, at least) as plain and is endlessly clumsy (though her clumsiness is so contrived that it seems like a magical Sue ability, practically).  She also has no interests, hobbies, or anything that she excels at in particular.  Despite these flaws, Bella nevertheless ends up a Sue because everyone loves her for reasons that defy explanation or logic.  Even when she is behaving in a selfish, whiny, and intolerable way, Bella is never called out for her behavior.  The only character who ever seems disgusted by Bella is Jessica, but since Jessica is written as a shrew anyway, we're clearly not meant to put much stock in her opinion.   2) FATED TRUE LOVE.  In my world, Fated True Love isn't romantic, it's lazy.  It says "hey, instead of working out why these characters are attracted to each other and showing how their relationship develops, I'm gonna just put it in the hands of FATE and have them fall in love for no reason whatsoever!"  Edward loves Bella because she smells good, which means Edward loves Bella like I love freshly baked bread.  Bella loves Edward because he's beautiful.  God-like.  So beautiful...really BEAUTIFUL, in case you missed it in all the numerous descriptive reminders.  But really, why do they love each other?  I have no idea.  Shakespeare was all too aware of the ridiculousness of star-crossed love, which is why he was smart and killed his teenaged lovers off.  But Bella and Edward's happiness hinges entirely on their togetherness.  What a strong, solid message to send to the young women of the world: happiness isn't something you create for yourself, oh no, it's something you can ONLY find in a beautiful, immortal man.  Bella's slow recognition of Jacob as a potential suitor was far more interesting and realistic, and it was teeth-gnashingly disappointing to see Bella repeatedly insist to herself that no one would ever do it for her again but Edward.  3) THE ZERO-HOUR PLOT.  Nothing much happens in Meyers' books, aside from Bella's enthrallment/suffering over Edward.  In the last few chapters, Meyers will attempt to inject some kind of conflict into the narrative, either in the form of James, Victoria, and Laurent ("Twilight") or the Volturi ("New Moon").  It's difficult to get invested in this conflict at the last minute, and again feels like a lazy, tacked-on, "oh right, I am writing a book, maybe something should happen!" move from the author.   Of course, as someone who hopes to be successful at writing teen fantasy, it's depressing to know that all I would need to do to achieve this success is construct a BORING SUE HEROINE, a FATED TRUE LOVE, and a ZERO HOUR PLOT.    Or maybe it's not depressing...maybe it's an incredible relief!  After all, coming up with those three things shouldn't be too hard.  If a lazy writer like Meyers can do it, anyone can!   For readers looking for good, solid teen-level fantasy featuring interesting heroines, more complex and realistic portrayals of love, and truly gripping plot, I recommend Diana Wynne Jones and Libba Bray.
sarcastic Take your friend out for beers before you waste your money on this thing. If you don't use it, it could last a very long time.
sarcastic People, this DVD is NOT for anyone who is already active and is less than 20 lbs. overweight. I bought this because it seemingly had three 20-minute cardio segments and I thought I'd get a great cardio workout. NOT. In the 1st segment, the instructor is primarily running his mouth (in an attempt to motivate) and not really participating much in the actual routine. All you see is several blubbery, out of shape, out of breath flabby folks who cannot stay in unison or use proper technique to save their lives. The viewer is left with a mish-mash of poor technique and a flamboyant instructor running his mouth (and hovering around the "boys"). This may be a helpful start for those who have never worked out in their lives and who are 75 lbs OR MORE overweight but for those of us who've been moderate-to extremely active and have less than 20-30 lbs. to lose, you may not find this DVD useful on any level. I am used to seeing in-shape and toned bodies on my workout DVD's, providing a VISUAL GOAL for myself. Right? Why would someone who is hoping to drop a few lbs want to see grossly out-of-shape folks on their TV screen? I give them props for getting off their bottoms and trying to get healthy. But I truly recommend this DVD to the extremely overweight and inactive. The other 2 segments at least have the instructors working out (more than the 1st instructor) but the routines are low-cardio and mundane. And of course, the group is way out of unison.  *I was aware that the Biggest Loser cast was in the video; I just didn't realize they'd be so awful and pathetic. Sorry for the unkind words.
sarcastic Ever notice in some of the reviews of this and similar books you'll sometimes see people refer to these books as &quot;my bible&quot;...contemplate that for a  moment... As Old Order  Establishments, such as Christianity,  painfully pass away, New Religions  rush in to fill the Void and &quot;Rationalism&quot; is one of them. The  Old Order was convinced that there was something &quot;wrong&quot; with  being human, (i.e. Original  Sin, The Fall, Ad Nauseam), and  Rational-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,(sounds Orwellian doesn't it?), makes  the same mistake, though it pretends not to. Orthodox religion presented to  us what was and was not acceptable, what was and was not healthy, and  Rationalism has been quick to catch the falling garter as Old Dame   Christianity slowly passes into obscurity. Old Dogma is replaced by New  Dogma; but not to worry, it's New and Improved Dogma...&quot;Studies  Show&quot;...and all that jazz. But to be &quot;Saved&quot; you  &quot;must&quot;,(very un-Ellisan word, even if that's what he's really  saying), refute the self-defeating words in your head with New Mantras and  a New Outlook, and Nothing can be really THAT bad can it? Qualitatively  speaking, how does
serious If you're thinking about buying a subwoofer, it is unlikely that you are a garden variety movie fan or lover of music.  People looking for subwoofers usually already have a decent system, but know that there is something lacking.  When it came for me to buy one, three factors weighed in my decision: power, brand, and (of course) price.  I've grown up with what I have always believed to be a 'healthy skepticism' when it comes to Sony products.  My father had an early generation (1990ish) 5.0 Sony 250 Watt surround amp that performed extremely poorly in just about every function.  The only advantage it had over his earlier (1978) Rotel non-tube amp is that it had multiple component inputs.  The sound quality of the 50 Watt rated Rotel amp blew the Sony out of the water.  In my search for a subwoofer, I was surprised to find so many good reviews of the Sony line.  I was looking for a better name than Sony, but when I compared prices, I was compelled to give the Sony at least a listen.  Comparable subs by Velodyne and others were far more expensive (double the cost of the Sony or more).  Listening to the Sony at the stereo shop, I must say that I was extremely impressed.    Is the Sony sound as good as the Velodyne or other high end subwoofers that cost 2-3 times as much as the Sony?  Of course not, but I quickly discovered that difference in sound quality was not at all closely related to the difference in price.  Keep in mind that this is one of Sony's smallest and lightest subs (only 25 lbs), but once I brought it home and hooked it up to my 6.1 surround system and configured the frequency and volume on the back of the sub, it seamlessly expanded the low end range of my system for music and movie playback.  Before I learned (by experimenting with them) how to adjust the levels on the back of the sub, it was quite boomy and there was a bit of a gap between the low end on the six surround speakers and where the sub picked up.  When I made the appropriate adjustments, by trial and error, I found that this sub is an extremely versatile fit for my home.  My family room is 17'x14', and the back opens into a 10'x15' living room, and the sub easily fills the room.  When I crank the system for rock and roll music and movies, the sub has no problem keeping up and is easily capable of playing more loudly than is safe or enjoyable.  Would I have liked a bigger sub made by a better brand?  Sure, but this one does the job (and then some) admirably, and for less than half the cost.  This sub gets 4 stars as a product, but I gave it 5 because of the extremely good value.  If you have a big budget and can afford to spend what it would take to buy a speaker that actually sounds better than one of these Sony subs, go for it, you will not be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you would rather spend less on a sub and still get excellent power and sound quality, this is as good as it gets without spending several hundred dollars.
serious This was a really good book. It is written in plain language and will make you think of someone you have known. It is quick read that keeps your attention till the very end. The sad thing is, it is a book about real people. Thank God there are only four of them per hundred, put they can leave a path of destruction in their wake. Being aware of who you share this world with is very important and knowing how to deal with the ones who don't seem "quite right" is a lesson well worth learning.
serious For a better fit, I ordered a "youth Large" because I have a small figure and didn't want a loose fit. The wolves on the t-shirt fade into the background a lot more than it shows in the picture. It creates a subtle effect, which I like.
serious I received this as a gift and it brought back a lot of memories.  I really loved it.  I'm not sure why there are some people who are disappointed because some of the candy is still available today.  That is very puzzling.  The candy names are right in the description.  You know before you buy it exactly what is in it.
serious I wanted to take advantage of the video capability on the Canon SD800IS digital camera and required a large memory card. Given the way memory requirements increase over time I opted for the largest available. I also wanted a fast memory write speed. The Transcend 8Gb SDHC Class 6 card was the best value available. So far this card has worked flawlessly.
serious This movie was excellent. I had avoided it because I thought it was  as the critics said. I should have known. The cast was great and worked together well.  The premise seemed to have jumped from the airwaves of coasttocoast,  which I happen to enjoy, and the technology, well, unobtainium says it all. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, since the real raw material for it was funobtainium.
serious New Moon starts out wonderfully - Edward's family throws Bella a birthday party, but when she has an accident and starts bleeding, the whole vampire household flips out. Consequently, Edward is filled with guilt and decides that she needs to lead a normal life without being endangered by their presence every day, and so they all pack up and leave. I nearly choked when I saw that time passes without him.  But, try as she might, Bella is empty without him. She realizes that when she is in danger, she can hear his voice in her head (usually yelling), and so she begins to pursue dangerous hobbies just to hear his voice again. One of these hobbies brings her into close friendship with Jacob Black, the Quileute Indian boy who tipped her off to Edward's identity in the first book, and he seems to temporarily appease her pain at Edward's absence. But Jacob has his own secrets, and Bella is again endangered when a vampire returns to Forks for revenge.  I must admit, most of the reason this book kept me up late reading was in hopes of word from Edward. Jacob and his friends were fun, and it *was* exciting to see another facet of the books' mythology, but almost the whole time Bella was with Jake, I was adamantly pining for Edward. When he does return, I was not disappointed, and Jake's involvement also sets up the potential for a powerful love triangle.  It wasn't quite as solid as the first book, but I sense that New Moon is an important transition. Many questions were brought up, like whether vampires have souls, and just how far must Bella and Edward go to stay together? She wants to become one of them, and Edward insists that she remain human. Now that we've caught wind of it, what exactly is agreed in the treaty the vampires have with the Quileutes? And what will Bella do now that her boyfriend and her best friend are mortal enemies? All of this feels like necessary groundwork in order to address these issues in the next book. I enjoyed New Moon immensely, despite Edward's absence for most of it, and I'm eager for the next installment; I can't wait to see how Meyer resolves some of these issues, and what ride we will experience in the next book.
serious This shirt is a very high standard and the company is an excellent company to deal with. The shirt is exactly as described and as i bought it as a christmas present has made the person i bought it for very happy. In the past i have had problems with third party sellers, however in this case i am more than satisfied and the five stars reflects their efforts as much as the product itself.  arrooooooooo!!!!
serious I have read about 5 books by Nora Roberts.  My favorite was Honest Illusions.  I tend to read historical romance.  A friend gave me my first Nora Roberts' book Born in Fire.  That series of three books held my  interest to try another book of Ms. Roberts.  Honest Illusions I could  keep; the others all went back.  Tucker and Caro were a good match, but my  favorite character was Cy.  I had a strong feeling who the killer was  during the pathology section in the book.  (Don't want to spoiler it for  others.)  The actual killer isn't revealed until about three pages before  the book ends; and I felt some people should have moved out-of-the-area (if  you catch my drift).  Hard for people to forget and forgive in a story  about serial killers.  Sorry all you Nora Roberts' fans.  I had better  stick to historicals.
serious This product does work....I have been using it for almost a month and my lashes are so long, they touch my eyebrows....I have also used this on my eyebrows and my brows are much more defined now....This product is amazing....I have ordered my second bottle.
serious To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.  I'll begin by saying that I've been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.  ProGlide vs. Hydro 5 Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.  What's included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.  Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette's as a travel holder with no problem.  Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.  The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro's trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.  Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as "suspension" for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.  On initial "hefting" the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.  The Shave Test All of the above are secondary to the "Yes, But How Does It Shave" test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream  and a badger bristle brush.  Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth) The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.  The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small "razor burn" marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.  Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.  The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face "dried" she still said the Gillette side was smoother.  Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth) The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.  ProGlide vs Quattro Shave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).  The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.  In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.  As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.  So what's not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.  While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn't shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.  Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.
serious I have to admit I was a bit reticent to get this one as there was some negativity about it. However, I am SO glad I listened to my gut instead of these others. It is one of the best books on pregnancy ever. I found out so much that I needed to know, that even my own doctor will not tell me, that I came away feeling better about the whole thing. So, if you are looking for a guide to pregnancy that will really, really tell you like it is, get this one. Another good one is: Really Pregnant! Confessions of a New Mom-To-Be or Why I Couldn't Stop Eating Brownies .
serious I ordered this as a 2nd monitor to replace the 19" CRT I had been using with my sys. My primary display is an Acer AL2002W, and wanted to match it up and decided to go with this as I could not find one or one close to it. This monitor is pretty much a internet monitor for use while working.  Pros: Great looking display. Text is tight and crips, blacks looks clean as do whites.  Cons: Thought that the info said this was a 1680*1050 display but that was a reviewer comment, not Amazon. True aspect 16:9@1600*900 60Hz  Other: For a good 2nd display, or even a Primay this is a good deal. Would have like a height adjustment, but as the AL2002W does not have this, was not expecting this one to either. For $120 I can't say anything bad about it other than what I noted under cons.
serious The post-apocalypse sub-genre of science fiction has always been a place I like to go.  I'll give movies of this type some slack I wouldn't always give other kinds, so that even a relatively weak post-apoc flick like Doomsday (in which Malcolm McDowell appeared, as he does here) still has its interesting moments. But if it's a good one such as I Am Legend, I'm really into it bigtime.  So I've been eagerly anticipating The Book of Eli from the time the first trailers appeared, and now that I've seen it there were many things about it I liked.  Start with the mythic prophet main character.  His super-heroic weapons skills showed there was something unique about him early on.  Those scenes were generally pretty cool, and they were spread out pretty well over the length of the film.  (Any more fight scenes would have bored me.)  Eli's story plays out with a kind of grim determinism, although it also has hopeful elements as well.  I was glad I wasn't previously familiar with the story, as the major revelations about the Book in the final act were a complete surprise.   Mr. Washington was an excellent choice for the lead.  Other roles were well cast too, including (to my surprise) Jennifer Beals as the blind mistress of Gary Oldman's bad boss character.  Oldman himself struck just the right notes of ego, madness & desperation.   Anyway, as far as the post-apoc nature of the movie, it provides fascinating glimpses of which possessions would be really valuable in such a world (ex., chapstick yes; cigarette lighter, not so much), and other aspects of survival felt very authentic throughout the film.  All in all, it wasn't quite the adventure I was expecting (with occasional pacing issues), but I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience.
serious Despite the fact that this is a "Dummies" book, it is actually quite detailed and scientific in nature.  A good review of basic facts in regards to male & female bodies, esp. for those of us who have been out of sex ed for a while now.  Also provides some thoughtful information for "beginners".    It also includes interesting extra facts & information, like sex during pregnancy, sex during menstruation, the importance of prostate & other male/female exams, interesting pros & cons of different positions, etc.  Also, Dr. Ruth's personality comes through in the book, which is generally a good thing.  She adds a touch of humor to this book, though at times a bit too quirky...    Overall, a good book for the topic and probably useful for parents wanting to speak to their kids about sex (or if they are too uneasy to give them the talk directly).
serious I've actually never read this before, but since I could get it for free on my Kindle, I thought it was worth a try.  So right!  It deserves its reputation.  A swashbuckling tale of intrigue and fun.  Truly worth the time it took to read it.
serious Did not work out of the box. One joystick was stuck permanently moving left. Returned and second one survived a few months before it quit working.
serious Funny, everyone seems so thrilled about how they come charged out of the box.  While this is nice and convenient, the bigger picture is *why* they can come charged out of the box: they discharge at a much slower rate than normal (NiMH) rechargeable batteries.  If you use your battery-needing product often, you may not notice this, but for things you use sporadically, this is a godsend.  No more coming home from vacation to find your TV remote control is dead.  No more grabbing your digital camera after three weeks of not using it only to find it won't start up.    These batteries are, indeed, the best of both worlds: they have the power and reuse advantages of a good NiMH battery, but the slow steady discharge of an Alkaline disposable.  Look no further -- this is the rechargeable you've been waiting for.  And if you had to guess, I'm happy with my first set and about to order more... :)
serious Followed the directions carefully to hang a small towel bar just like the picture shows on the package. Within 5 minutes everything crashed to the floor. So I started over, even taped the towel bar in place for extra support. Waited 24 hours to remove the tape, instant crash to the floor. This stuff doesn't work, AND they give you one glove, not 2, for those of us with sensitive skin. It is hard to knead with just one hand.
serious This book is really beautiful the scenes are like a gentle lullaby and to boot its educational I recommend all Thomas Lockers books!
serious Dr. Robert Hare opens to the layman the world of the psychopath without burying him in technical overload.  Well done!
serious Pete Townshend possibly feels a lot like David O. Selznick, the producer of the movie `Gone With The Wind' in fearing that he will only be remembered in his obituary by his creating that one work, as Townshend, like Selznick, seems to have been spending his time after completing their most important work in trying to top it.  To my mind, Townshend should have no regrets about not topping `Tommy', as it is easily one of the two or three most important albums and works in the entire Rock canon, similar in importance and possibly superior in quality to `Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and `Blond on Blond', to name just two others high in the ranks of great Rock albums.  One thing which surprises me about writing on `Tommy' is how little deep analysis has been essayed about the story behind the songs. In a nutshell, the story is this:  Tommy Walker is born while his father is off on some journey (`It's a boy') from which he becomes several years late in returning. Tommy's mother takes up with a lover, father returns, mother and lover kill father with Tommy as a witness, and mother and lover tell Tommy he saw and heard nothing (`You didn't hear it'). Tommy becomes functionally blind, deaf, and dumb to all outside appearances, however, it is evident that within his own head, he can see and hear everything (`There's a doctor I've found'). He is tormented by various malicious relatives (`Cousin Kevin' and `Fiddle About') and `treated' by various attempts, including hallucinogens (`Acid Queen'). As he grows up, the only outside experience to which he responds is a pinball machine, at which he becomes expert (`Pinball Wizard'). Tommy is finally cured by watching his image in a mirror smashed by, I believe, his mother's lover (`Smash the Mirror'). Being released from his isolation for Tommy is like being released from a practically lifelong mystical experience heightened by pinball. The charisma with which Tommy is imbued by this experience leads him to become a `New Messiah' (`Sally Simpson') creating a movement which expands beyond local resources (`Welcome') and becomes institutionalized into a ritual modeled after playing pinball while deaf dumb and blind (`Tommy's holiday camp'). The story ends with a revolt of Tommy's disciples against his new religion (`We're not gonna take it').  The theme of being oppressed runs throughout practically all of Townshend's work, although in `Tommy', it takes a back seat to mysticism. The people who dote on the philosophical background of  `The Matrix' should sink their teeth into the `Tommy' story and ruminate on that a while. The major musical theme of the work seems to be Townsend's search for a magical chord. And, anyone who, like myself, has seen `Tommy' performed live by the original Who will have no trouble believing Townsend has found his chord as he hits that first great whirlwind chord in `Pinball Wizard'. Talk about a rush! In general, a lot of the music echoes earlier Who works. Townshend seems to constantly cut and paste phrasings from one work to another and I have no problem with this except in the most tedious of the three instrumental pieces (`Underture') in the album.  Some writers have said that 'Tommy' is more like an Oratorio or a Song Cycle than it is an Opera, but I disagree. Neither of these other two genres requires a plot, and an Opera does, and Tommy has a plot. I prefer to think of it as a selection of arias and instrumental passages from which some bridging dialogue has been left out. My biggest problem with this plot is that the actual event that triggers Tommy's autism is only hinted at in the most vague of terms. It is easy to believe that it was a murder, but the lyrics of `You Didn't Hear It' never come even close to saying exactly what the event was. On the other side of the coin, the great majority of the songs on the album `Tommy' directly support carrying the story forward. Practically the only exception is the Sonny Boy Williamson classic `Eyesight to the Blind'. It is probably symptomatic that only `Pinball Wizard', `I'm Free', and `Sensation' out of the 24 cuts in `Tommy' really work for the Who outside the context of the whole work. That's why I'm especially happy to have seen The Who perform virtually the whole album live, four days after it was initially released. It is also interesting to see that the two cuts describing episodes of sadism were written by Entwistle and not Townshend.  This CD contains exactly what was on my original vinyl two record album bought in 1969, suitably enhanced with modern electronics. My greatest respect for Townshend is for creating a classic musical form, the Opera, using an entirely ROCK instrument, with the slightest classical leavening from John Entwistle's French horn on a few early numbers. So many `rock' versions of traditional forms simply overlay rock performances on classical arrangements or make classical arrangements of rock melodies. Aside from `Quadrophenia', the only other work which succeeds at doing this is Spooky Tooth/Pierre Henry work `Ceremony An Electronic Mass'.  Listening to this album and every other early Who album reminds one just how much their performances were a collaborative effort between the original four, and how much we miss Keith Moon and John Entwistle today. We can only say that with `Tommy' and numerous other works and recorded performances, the memory of The Who will live forever.  Seminal work in the history of Rock. 
serious Now that I've had the EB1501 integrated into my home theater for a few weeks, I thought I would update my review of it.  I have this connected via HDMI to receiver, surround sound and a 52" HDTV. Due to the limitations of my setup (not the EB1501), I do not use HDMI for sound, so I will not say anything about the box's ability to carry both signals properly.  If you use S/PDIF for audio, you are going to appreciate the included adapter (works great).  I was going to use Boxee or XBMC, but I don't like the hassle of setting up and integrating Tv tuners into those, so I am using Windows 7's Media Center.  The EB1501 is EVERYTHING I have been looking for in a HTPC.  It runs (very) cool and (very) quiet.  It's barely noticeable yet attractive enough to not have to hide - which makes it easier to get to the DVD drive, power, ports, etc...   The computer is stable and a workhorse for this task.    With the Atom processor, I wouldn't recommend trying to do too much gaming or heavy multitasking.  As a component in a home theater, this thing runs circles around the almost useless Media Center Extender I was using before.
serious I have not had a chance to really use it.  I bought it for an emergency, but I have no doubt it will work fine if military is using it. =)
serious This is the best waffle maker I have ever owned.  I made waffles for a gang at our work holiday party with rave reviews.  Easy to use and they come out perfect everytime.  The reminder beeps are helpful to know when they are done.  Just put the batter in, flip it and wait for the beep!  It is a special treat when I pull this out in the morning.
serious I've read some of the other reviews concerning this printer discussing noise, print time and paper handling.  Well, here's me take.  I have had the printer for over a month now.  The printer is far quieter than the Photosmart 7550 I had before (it sounded like two monkies with hammers were working inside). The 8000 is very quiet to me.  I use a PC with the XP op system and it takes a total of 30 seconds to print anything I've printed so far.  It usually takes 12 to 14 seconds to initiallize and around 15 to 18 seconds to print the page - whether all text or partial graphics.  I've not had any paper handling issues either - though I do just use HP All Purpose paper.  I haven't tried unusual paper types.  Bottom line: if you just want a printer you can count on for everyday stuff then this is the one.
serious Ashlee Simpson is the girl who got caught lip-syncing on SNL, so her CDs must not be very good, right?   Wrong.   After all, everyone from KISS too Evanescence have admitted to using backing vocals live. But does that mean they make bad CDs?   Not at all.   Autobiography is am excellent teen-pop disk. Period. Most people will take their aggressions out on this CD since it has the name Ashlee Simpson attached to it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't contain some of the catchiest pop-rock tunes this decade.  Of course, it's not for everyone. Music snobs who like "important" tunes (i.e.: Death Cab for Cutie, Radiohead, etc.) will not like this CD. It's total fluff, but it's the kind of catchy, fun fluff you can't help but blast in your car and scream along to.   (In fact, you can practically hear groups of giggling girls at a slumber party somewhere singing along with you.)  Best Tracks: Autobiography, Pieces of Me, Shadow, LaLa (!!), Love Me for Me, Undiscovered  Don't be embarrassed! Buy this CD and let your inner teen loose.  
serious These pills will definitely help you lose weight, though I think a large component of the weight lost is merely water. Like other reviewers have stated, this product will dehydrate you like nothing else. It does a great job at suppressing your appetite, so when you do eat, you're more likely to "remember" to eat something healthy - as opposed to raiding the fridge when you're ravenous.   These pills have helped me lose weight (I'm not talking a ton of weight, but enough to keep me re-purchasing the product). My only complaint is this: this seller - and many sellers of this product - claim the following: "PACKAGES WITH SILVER ON BOTH SIDES ARE FAKE! The authentic capsules are are packaged with green foil on one side and silver on the other. Beware of sellers that lie to you about all silver packaging. The fake all silver packaging is not effective, so don't waste your money." See above item description.   Uh, anyway -- the item I received had silver on BOTH sides. Does that mean the seller sold me a fake product? If so, why would he/she broadcast that? Who knows. I ordered these pills before from a different seller and the packaging has ALWAYS been silver on both sides. Perhaps this seller can  either 1) remove that verbiage that says the product I purchased from his/her company is FAKE, or 2) clarify whether the packaging has changed since the above claim.
serious I ordered this for my grandmother, she has trouble with her legs. I got it, put he batteries in, and it didn't work. I called the company and they sent me a return lable to mail it back. I told them I wanted a new one to see if I could get one that worked and filled out the slip to get a replacement. A few days later I got an email from amazon for a refund. I don't know if there was a misunderstanding or maybe there weren't anymore in stock. I decided to not try to reorder this product. If I had to rate just the customer service, I would have given higher then a 1..The guy on the phone was very understanding and fast at getting the return lable to me.
serious Unbelievable video footage that is complimented by the narrator.  Interesting information.  Well worth repeated viewing.  Only criticism I would have is there is some repetition.  Otherwise, fantastic.  My four-year-old son loves watching this constantly.
serious It is easy to understand why all the reviews here are either five stars or one star.  There is no middle ground here.  This book is wonderfully written and contains very little rehashed material which at this point is very hard to do.  The best part is the critical analysis of Hillary's past  writings and how they expose a hidden political agenda.  Olson's analysis  of the First Lady's seemingly unaltered radical persuasion is convincingly  demonstrated in this meticulously  researched biography. This type of writing  is not one star.  One star is like trying to bury the many insights  which this book magnificently exposes.  Bravo Barbara!
serious When Reno the Dog's cop companion, Lou Swanson (Carmine Caridi), is killed by a 'white supremacist' group of terrorists, he gets teamed up with tough cop Jake Wilder (Chuck Norris) to bring the bad guys down.  As you may have noticed, my movie summary for "Top Dog" was done in one whole sentence. That's because the story itself is quite simple for all audiences. It's the classic formula: good guys vs. bad guys. There are no `in-betweens' or `switching' of the good and bad so it's easy to keep track of who-is-who.  Unfortunately, though the classic formula `good vs. bad' most often works well, "Top Dog" had more `bad moviemaking' going for it than any `good moviemaking' to make this movie worth watching. Of course, it IS entertaining, but how far will one go to be `just' entertained?  Chuck Norris, never really being known for his acting abilities, seems at times to be enjoying himself but on the whole, he just lets everything flow on its own. Not once does he try to make his character his own, unique one. But that could be because the director does not really give him a chance to really do anything.  Instead, the audience is made to suffer somewhat by having to endure a bigger version of `Benji' for the hero of the film. There were mixed reviews on Amazon as to whether they liked Reno or not but in my opinion, Reno just did not impress. While, no doubt about it, we are continually made to believe that Reno is very intelligent (and sometimes he IS), there are times where he's just annoying. The ending was too contrived and moments where Reno is supposed to be cute just doesn't come out well. To sum up, everything Reno does is nothing special. If you've seen other `dog' movies like "K-19" or "Turner and Hooch", there is nothing in "Top Dog" which you haven't seen before.  The music was also badly done, especially the scene where the terrorists are trying to take out Chuck Norris at his house. The whole scene is supposed to be exciting, but the music utterly throws all suspense out. And... the terrorists are wearing clown masks?!?!   Ultimately, I believe that the main thing that went wrong with "Top Dog" is that the filmmakers couldn't quite make up their minds whether to make this a movie for children or for adults. While rated PG-13, the movie seems to be aimed for a younger audiences with having Reno the Dog as a main character. But at the same time, having terrorists and some violence would have children turning away, especially the murder of Lou Swanson. Adults however will probably be repelled from the storyline and the fact of having Reno the Dog in the story.   So, in conclusion, "Top Dog" can hardly be considered a classic so I really won't put this on my `recommend to others' list. My advice, if you still want to watch the movie, probably better to rent than actually buy it. Trust me, it's not worth it. The only thing that might interest viewers is watching Chuck Norris `do his thing', or shall we say, using his fighting skills. But definitely not top-notch stuff compared to other kung fu movies.
serious When I told the seller that I am having the funeral service for my dad in less than a week, he delivered the urn to me in two days with no extra charge. I am extremely happy with the urn and the service. Highly recommend.
serious This shaver is the third Norelco model I've had in 15 years... and without question the best and closest shaving of all!  From the side grip ridges (surrounding the head) that give an additionally secure feel to the handling... to the wash-out feature that affords easiest clean-up the 7310 is topnotch at a reasonable price! Highly recommended!
serious This was the third monitor I bought for our second child.  Don't waste your time trying the least expensive ones like I did, this one is worth the money.  I have the Super Clear Double Receiver by Safety 1st in my 2 year old's room, which works perfect.  I needed a second one for my newborn.  I tried another Safety 1st, and even with 2 channels, I could only pick up sound from one room.  Then I returned it for a Sound N Lights monitor by Fisher-Price.  Bigger mistake, we couldn't hear any room, only major static.  Finally we tried this one and love it!!!  It is so quiet, except, of course, when your baby makes noise.  I can't believe how many channel options it has, and other features too, like an alarm when you are almost out of range.  Also, a rechargable battery, that charges when plugged in, so you don't have to waste your own batteries when wanting to use it outside.  Go for the Gold, this Sony is the best yet.
serious The clone walker battle pack 8014 comes with 4 clone troopers [2] regular troopers [1] gunner [1] commander  and I really love the set!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the chicken walker or whatever its called. It also comes with flick fire missiles,I really love that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And movable legs!!!! I advise that anybody who plans to build armies  should use this set to do it.Well that is my review,bye!!!!!!!!!  
serious This is tool is sensitive enough to detect higher than normal EMF's. I took it around my house just to make sure it's working and it hit everywhere I knew there were high emfs, without fail. the light is bright enough to see yet not so bright that you lose your night vision. if you need more precise readings I would suggest getting something digital but this works great for me.
serious Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl tells of a young Jewish girl's experiences through adolescence in the midst of World War II and Hitler's genocide against her people.  On her thirteenth birthday, she was given a  diary in which to write her thoughts and feelings.  She, her family, the  Van Daan family, and Dr. Dussel tried to adjust to life in the Secret  Annexe.  Her diary, which she named Kitty, was written from her heart with  no superficiality.  This makes reading it a great experience. 	She  discussed in the book many issues prevalent in her life as a Jew.  She  talked about the Zionist movement and the hardships Jews endured in Nazi  Germany.  They could only shop in certain stores designated for Jewish use.   She wrote about her father and sister's fear of deportation, which would  have almost definitely resulted in going to a deadly concentration camp. 	 It is a good read because of the way it intertwines childhood and the  Holocaust and speaks of both candidly.  She wrote about her feelings and  encounters with friends and family.  She let out her anger at Hitler and  described the new reforms that made her life much harder.  She thought she  had found a good friend in Kitty.  Little did she know that one day her  story would impact thousands around the world, even if she was only a young  girl.
serious Great product at a great price. It is not a very large microwave but it does a lot and saves me a lot of counter space by not having multiple appliances that one microwave/convection over can do. I have shopped around for similar products before buying this one and similar products go for a lot more. This one looks good, performs well and is affordable.
serious I've had my Kindle 2 since 2/24 and I loved it at first.  Today is the first day when we have had bright sunshine, so I took the Kindle out in the sun and was dismayed to see that the text (particularly near the center of the screen) faded within seconds. Alt-G refresh of the screen restored the text temporarily but further sun exposure resulted in screen fading.  This is not a problem with the Kindle 1.  Ever since I got the Kindle 2, its text has been lighter than my K1, but not so much that I couldn't tolerate it The fading in sunlight makes the text virtually unreadable.  I contacted customer support (and mind you I have the extended warranty that allegedly give you advance replacement) and was told that A REPLACEMENT WOULD NOT FIX EITHER OF THE PROBLEMS and that what I should do if I were dissatisfied is simply return the Kindle 2 and all the accessories I ordered for it.  Needless to say, I am a very unhappy camper. If replacing my current K2 will not fix the problem, then that means that   a) they have not identified the source of the problem and  b) that any K2 currently purchased will have a similarly defective screen.  My advice: STAY AWAY FROM THE KINDLE 2 at least until Amazon acknowledges there is a problem and provides a fix. For me, I plan to stay away from the Kindle 2 forever.   Thank heavens I didn't sell my Kindle 1!!  ADDENDUM:  Following the events above, I sent feedback to Amazon about how dissatisfied I was with Customer Support.  The next day I did get a call back from someone else in Kindle support who agreed to send a replacement Kindle 2 out ASAP.  It should arrive Tuesday and I will post followup once I have a chance to check it out in bright sun.  FWIW, however, I have decided to hang onto my K1 just in case.  ADDENDUM 2:  After two replacements, I finally got a K2 that does reasonably well in terms of the darkness of the text and one on which the text does not fade in the sun.  I say "reasonably well" because the text is still noticeably lighter than the text on my K1.    Despite the lighter text, I prefer the K2 for its thinness and its improved navigation and I use if far more than my K1.
serious I bought these bibles to give as gifts to my friends that love stock car racing. They were impressed with the stories of the race drivers they found in the bible. I gave one to my church to help reach  young people that might otherwise not pickup a bible. I wish they would make one for motorcycle riders.  I am a member of CMA and would use this as an outreach tool.  Chris Cline, Overland Park, KS
serious This is a great laptop for the price.  It functions beautifully for basic use (school, work, surfing the web, etc.).  I have had absolutely no trouble with mine, and would highly recommend this product to everyday users.   I've seen a couple of bad reviews simply because users purchased this computer with the intent to make it their "gaming" computer, and then were disappointed with the outcome.  Check the specs and your game requirements first.  If you truly want a gaming computer, you probably shouldn't be looking at Laptops in the first place.    It's a great computer at a reasonable price.  If you just need something for work, school, and surfing the web, it's perfect.
serious With this his first novel, author William Golding wrote a novel that he could never surpass in greatness. Lord of the Flies is a novel about our human nature. Too often I think, people jump to quick conclusions about the book and Golding's stand on human nature. "His stance is too pessimistic" or "That books really gross." What these people fail to realize is that Golding tried to paint a picture of human nature as he saw it. He wasn't making things up, I don't think he was particularly angry, he wrote Lord of the Flies to expose people to the atrocities that he witnessed in World War II.  One of the largest underlying principles in Lord of the Flies is of course, human nature. William Golding gives the reader three interesting characters to analyze: Jack, Piggy, and Ralph. It's quite apparent as you read the novel that Golding must have read a little Sigmund Freud before writing Lord of the Flies. Let's start with Jack. Jack is the definite Id on the island. He wants to survive but he also wants to eat meat and have fun. Jack is clearly unable to control these urges and in turn has a pretty large influence on the other boys on the island. Piggy is the definite Superego on the island. Piggy is always referring to "well my auntie..." and always finds an excuse not to do something. Piggy has no intentions of satisfying his id, and in turn influences only Ralph and Simon. Ralph on the other hand, takes the middle road. He is clearly trying to find a way to satisfy his id, but he can't seem to find one. Take what he said in chapter eight for instance: "...Without the fire we can't be rescued. I'd like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning..." Ralph is definitely trying to satisfy his id, but those laws of culture still remain with him, telling him it's not the thing a proper English boy should do.  Another interesting connection I made while reading, was one between Jack's status of leader and the ideology of Thomas Hobbes. Unlike Hobbes though, Jack's power was used for quite the opposite affect. Hobbes believed that in order for a perfect society to exist, a higher power had to be in charge, in order to keep the other citizens in check. Jack was that higher power on the island. He was in control of everything, however, his power had quite the opposite affect of "keeping people in check." Jack used the powerful persuasion of the id to persuade others. Jack could promise meat and fun, whereas Ralph could promise labor and fruit, something the other boys definitely didn't want.  Lord of the Flies is also a novel filled with symbolism. Probably the most important of these symbols was the conch. The conchs represented several things, including freedom and order on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, unity between the boys. One of the most interesting aspects to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a lack of leadership or strength on Piggy's part. The conch became a tool of free speech. Those who wanted to speak at the tribal council had to hold the conch in order to be heard. However, as the story progressed, this practice diminished more and more, until the island was a place of complete chaos and anarchy. In one of the last chapters of the novel, the conch gets completely destroyed. This symbolizes two things. First, it symbolizes the end of order on the island- no more meetings, no more assemblies, none of that, the island was a place of anarchy. Secondly, this destruction symbolizes the end of Ralph's leadership. The boys had become slaves to Jack and his power, their conscience gave in.   Finally, about the novel itself. Golding is quite obviously a fan of Joseph Conrad. The writing style is almost identical, and the subject matter is very similar, with Golding opting to use children (young boys) instead of the men of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The novel moves very quickly and it's rather short (202 pages in my copy.) You'll be immersed in the varying characters and degrees of humanity that they present. Keep in mind, that although Golding's view on humanity may seem very pessimistic, he's writing from his perspective on human nature, something that he witnessed first hand during WWII.
serious I've loved everything Black Eyed Peas have done so far and haven't been disappointed with this CD.  So many times I will buy a CD and only found 1 or 2 tracks I like but there is not one song I don't like on this CD.  All the songs are fun, energetic and simply great to listen to. Buying this CD will be a great addition to your playlists.
serious I bought the 855 as an upgrade to my StreetPilot C550.  I was reluctant to buy it, based on the less-than-stellar reviews on here, but after using it for a week, I have no complaints at all.  Maybe that's due to the fact that I'm upgrading from the ancient 550, and not the 7X5 series.  The other reviewers are right, the on/off switch can be awkward, and you need a fingernail to push it over to the left.  But that is such a minor complaint, in my opinion.  Also, some people say they like the smoother refresh that the 7X5 series has, and this is more jerky, as you move along your route.  Well, you're not supposed to be watching it when you're driving anyway.  Oh, and it only has 500 waypoints, compared to 1000 on other models.  I'll be lucky if I use 100.  What makes this GPS so remarkable is the voice recognition!  I feel like I'm using Star Trek technology.  It rarely has any problem understanding what I tell it.  Hands free GPS navigation!  I never have to pull over to type a new destination (or try to do it while driving).  I can't imagine any of the minor complaints offsetting the awesomeness of the voice recognition.  Now that it's available, I wouldn't have a GPS unit without it.  If your budget allows for a voice recognition GPS with 1000 waypoints, an improved on/off switch, and smoother screen refresh, then by all means get that one.  But if you're looking to spend about $300, and want voice recognition, do not hesitate to buy the 855.  I wouldn't exchange it for a non-voice recognition unit that has those features that this one lacks.
serious First of all, apologies to all of you who are huge fans of this series of books.  I'm sure you'll hate this review, but remember, this is just one person's opinion.  I was drawn to this series due to all of the press it's been receiving lately, and also because I'm up for a good, escapist vampire novel now and then.  I actually bought the whole box set when it came out recently, but am putting my review here (instead of with the boxed set) because I didn't even get past this first book.  The book did not hold my interest at all, and believe me, I tried to like it.  I've been attempting to figure out what the problem is.  It's not the setting; I was born in Louisiana, so the setting was one of the attractions of the book.  It's not the overall, view-from-30,000-feet story; that was fine.  So what was it?  I'd have to say it was more structural than anything else, for lack of a better word.  I found Ms. Harris' writing to be on par with what an average ninth grader might produce.  The characters, even the main ones, were a bit on the superficial side and weren't really fully developed.  The plot details were quite boring, not engaging at all.  The love scenes were a bit cringe-worthy, reminiscent of scenes from poorly executed smut novels (i.e. just as with smut novels, these parts struck me as nothing more than a fantasy on the part of the author).  Overall, the simple fact that I found the book disappointing *IS* the most disappointing part.  That is, if I hadn't had such high hopes, it wouldn't be such a let down.  The story and characters had oodles of potential.
serious Good price, service and very fast shipping. Not really happy with this product cause it states that it can handle up to 8 lbs and in reality, it can't. I have 7 lb speakers that have stressed them to the point of almost failure (when mounting on the wall). After changing the mounting position from the side wall to the ceiling they are handling it much better. These mounts are only good for small speakers (like Bose) when wall mounting. If you are going to use them for heavy (capacity maxed) speakers, you should hang them from the ceiling.
serious No, doubt the far left will be outraged over Laura Ingraham's "The Obama Diaries."  I think Laura Ingraham has brilliantly exposed the Obama Regime's hypocrisy of change you can believe in.  The Diaries are done in the tradition of Alice in Wonderland.  You know Ms. Ingraham has hit a nerve when the lame stream media i.e. MSNBS, ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN are outraged by the Diaries. Laura Ingraham is right on in demonstrating the total disconnect between the American People and the alternate Obama Universe of trashing are traditional values, and dividing our Nation on racial grounds and class warfare. I am sure that Obama Diaries will be a best seller, to the dismay of Ms. Ingraham's Critics. Ms. Ingraham Critics should remember the more they condemn the Obama Diaries the more books will be sold. I am sure Ms. Ingraham is laughing as she goes to the bank.  Job, well done Laura.
serious This is the second Magellan RoadMate 1420 4.3 in GPS Navigator I have purchased, my wife and I both have one. The 1420 GPS is very light and only 1/2 inch thick. It has an easy to use and read touch screen. I bought a bean bag mount and can easily remove from car to prevent thieft.
serious I loved this book--I don't know when I've laughed so hard.  Maybe it helps that I'm a &quot;liberal&quot;--but what makes this a good book rather than just a book that says things I happen to agree with is that it's clever and well-executed.  The humor runs from silly to witty, but it's pretty consistently funny.   It's too bad the satire seems to be lost on some people.  The point of the book is that Franken is using the same methods that Rush Limbaugh &amp; co. use in a _satirical_ fashion in order to expose these methods as ridiculous.  Take his &quot;interview&quot; with Rush Limbaugh, modeled after the latter's &quot;interview&quot; with Hillary Clinton.  Yes, obviously it's quite easy to come up with the same sort of &quot;interview&quot; with Al Franken, but that doesn't do much to hurt his case.  The point of the Rush Limbaugh interview isn't so much to make Rush admit that he is indeed a big fat idiot by taking his words out of context as to make fun of the idea of such an interview as a cheap shot with which you can make anyone say anything.  So you can't really use Franken's methods against him to make him out to be a hypocrite, because the basis of the book is a humorous refutation of those very methods.  That's why it's funny.
serious Our son received this as a gift before he turned 1. Although he could not sort the blocks then, he started trying. It was amazing to watch him over the next year change the way he played with the toy. Initially he just played with the blocks, then threw them in the bucket, dumped them out again. He would also carry the bucket with blocks around by the handle. Later he was able to put in the round one, then another and within a short time all of them. He still likes playing with it. It was apparent that he had a sense of achievement after each new "accomplishment". I highly recommend this toy.
serious I just loved Karen's Time travel series, but when I started to read her new series, I was VERY disapointed! She is such a good writer, but her new series is, well, not good.... I wish she would return to the writing she does best...
serious As if riding a 1947 Vespa in olive-drab green weren't enough, I also wear this helmet.  My roommate was worried I'd get beaten up; I thought people would be amused.  I was right.  It's a good-looking helmet and very well-made.  It's also fairly light weight considering how substantial it is.  A word of warning, however -- it is much thicker than what you might expect -- think Darth Vader-sized as opposed to trim barely-bigger-than-your-head like you see in the movies.  I see that someone hasn't received what they ordered from Jafrum, and I feel bad for them.  I received it faster than I expected, actually, ready to go the moment it came out of the box.
serious I actually bought this book to give to my brother as a joke, and decided to read through it first.  I found it to be a very interesting account of  the abduction phenomenon.  While I don't believe that people are actually  being abducted by spacemen in flying saucers (a view the author seems to  share, incidently), I now believe this phenomenon is very real, and  probably very puzzling and frightening to the people who experience it.   For those people, this book should be an invaluable aid to help them take  control of their situation.  Recommended for anyone interested in the  subject.
serious Product arrived quickly and was just as advertised. installation was a snap. I would buy again if needed
serious The Lasko 4000 Oscillating Ultra Slim Fan is perfect for circulating cool air in a small office space.  The fan easy fits on a small computer desk, circulates air quietly, and has the benefit of a low and high speed. The slim, small size makes this fan unobtrusive. Very satisfied.
serious We love the Earth's Best line in our house. Our 9 mo old daughter  will ONLY eat Earth's Best dinners, and I don't blame her. The smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. I've sampled the Earth's best dinners myself, and they aren't half bad... It is baby food.... The fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well.
serious Product is great for the price.  I actually bought these to light up my American Flag at night.  Which is what you are suppose to do if you have a Flag hanging at night.  I am using both of them to light the Flag up.  No great big spotlight but what I needed and a price I wanted.
serious This is a great book for kids starting to learn their letters and sounds. A must have.
serious After getting divorced at age 40, Nina Askew moves into an apartment and plans to get a puppy to keep her company.  Instead she ends up with Fred, a smelly and depressed beagle/bassett hound cross.  Fred is instrumental in her meeting her downstairs neighbor, the ER doctor Alex.  They are meant to be together, but Alex and Nina both think the other party won't be interested because of the age difference - Alex is ten years younger than Nina.  The characters are likeable, especially Fred, but the book was rather predictable.  At the end there are some easily-resolved misunderstandings thrown in that seem to be there just to make the book reach the 200-page mark.
serious I purchased this tool to become more familiar with my cycles. Ouch isn't something you really want to feel when you use a speculum. It may not be the most comfortable situation but it should not *hurt*. It's really appalling how many fake "funny or joke reviews" are on this subject. It's sad that a women's health tool has to be the subject of objectification or a joke. I truly encourage all the women I know to get more in touch with their cycles and their cervix. Empower yourself! It's a beautiful thing. A speculum is a wonderful tool!!  I purchased this to become more familiar with my cycles and to also become more familiar with my cervix. You can tell SO much about ovulation by checking your cervix. When you are TTC, this is invaluable. It's a relatively inexpensive tool.   Anyways, this speculum was *not* what I expected at all. One of the blades was much shorter than the other making it impossible to insert. No matter how much lube I used, or how relaxed I was, it wouldn't insert itself comfortably. I chose to buy this one instead of plastic for environmental reasons but I regret the decision as I cannot even use it. I have since ordered a pack of plastic speculums and already used one of those. It fit SO much more comfortably. I was hoping I didn't have to buy plastic but I did.   The shipper did get the item to me in a timely manner so if you'd like to try it for yourself, you can count on fast shipping.   Would definitely not make this purchase again based on the ease of use of this speculum. It hurt too much and I have a pretty decent tolerance for discomfort.   (this all may be TMI but what did you expect in a product review for a speculum?)
serious THESE ARE THE BEST. THE GRAPHICS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND STILL LOOK NEW AFTER SEVERAL WASHINGS. I OWN TWO AND PLAN ON BUYING MORE.
serious *updated review at bottom*  original review: So I bought this phone via sprint when it came out, should've waited for amazon, would've saved me about 75 dollars. ANYHOO! I love this phone!  Pros: -All the apps, music capabilities, etc that the iphone has -Decent sound quality (I hear everyone crystal clear) -Touchscreen everything but you can use the optical mouse and slide out keyboard (which I love) -Extremely intuitive. I only had to refer to the manual once so far (had it about a week now) and that was to take the battery cover off (which I never ended up getting to in the book because I slid it off). -Decent battery life  -regular headphones work with it  Cons: - it's supposed to be 5.5 hours of talk time, but if you talk on it for 2 hours straight while playing games online (on the phone), it tends to be a bit shorter! So battery life took a star. Also regular usage gets it only 9 or 10 hours before you want to charge to be on the safe side. - If you put a pattern lock (have to draw a specific design/connect dots) on the phone to prevent it from doing things by accident via touch screen, it has a one-touch EMERGENCY DIAL button always present when you unlock the phone to use it. Which routes directly to your county 911. And if you realize it too late and hang up quickly the 911 operator calls you back to make sure you're ok. Which is a good idea but horrible if you're half asleep and grab the phone to check a text message.  I'll update if I find anything new awesome and or horribly bad with it.  But it's perfect for me. So I definately recommend.  **update November 27, 2009**  So I've had this phone almost a month now and still in love with it. I did have a problem with the speaker phone not working (I could hear everyone crystal clear, but I was fading in and out even if I was not moving in a silent room with no background noise. Yes, I made someone help me test this before I officially concluded it WAS my phone afterall). I took it back to the Sprint Store I got it from (a few blocks from me) and they replaced it that day no charge at all (it has a 30 day unlimited warranty. This was about a week after I got the phone).  I've come to terms with the battery life issue after consulting with someone who has a g1 and has the same low battery problems. So it lasts me about 5-8 hours a day (usually tons of texting involved and applications being played) before it gives me the low battery (15% remaining) warning. Then I come home and stick it on the charger or just let it be until I know I can dedicate 3-4 hours to charging this baby up. (It did however last me from 1pm yesterday afternoon to 8am this morning with moderate texting and phone usage only before dying. Was able to make a phone call immediately once it was attached to the charger though).  I still believe is the perfect phone for me of all out there on the market (and yes, I played with the Droid but hate the keyboard). It is sluggish to touch sometimes, double tapping the screen to "wake it up" during a phone call can inadvertantly lead to hanging up sometimes, and when you're typing very fast it doesn't always imput it right away or will get backed up on a few letters. I've been using it as an mp3 player and hooking it to my car speakers while driving. It can charge AND play music at the same time. Some applications and games ARE more draining then others though, but you can generally figure out which ones.  It's still, in my opionion, an all around wonderful phone.  ***UPDATE *JULY 15, 2010* *** So still have the same actual phone as I did last time update, it's gone through 2 sprint updates needed to be done in store. So some changes to original review needed! The updates have fixed the issues of super short battery life (extremely high android/internet usage for a 16 hour period before needing a charge and otherwise normal usage (frequent but not high texting, somewhat high internet usage) will last the day (8am to 3am, so 29 hours roughly). Updates also fixed (apparently) the speakerphone issue and the mute button issue and the issue of hanging up accidently while trying to wake screen up during phone call.   The android has been updated to 2.2 (or 2.1, double check on that. HAS BEEN UPDATED TO ONE OF THOSE THOUGH!).   Touch screen occasionally will be taken over by ghosts (not really often, but enough to be mentioned), but I think that has more to do with the screen covers I put on there.   The camera and video features now have zoom! Not a very BIG zoom, but a zoom nonetheless.  Still love the phone, still recommend! :-)    
serious Based on reading Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker and Moneyball, I wondered whether The Big Short would prove to be entertaining and informative.  If you've read some of Lewis' books, you might agree that the "entertaining" part would seem to be a reasonably safe bet.  It turns out, it is.  The Big Short is fast-paced, straightforward, conversational and salty--very much like his earlier works.  Indeed, if you didn't know Michael Lewis had written this book, you could probably guess it.  It is easy reading and very hard to put down.  In short (no pun), The Big Short doesn't disappoint in being entertaining.  In a sense, this book is similar to Moneyball in that Lewis tells his story by following a host of characters that most of us have never heard of--people like Steve Eisman (the closest thing to a main character in the book), Vincent Daniel, Michael Burry, Greg Lippmann, Gene Park, Howie Hubler and others.  How informative is the book?  Well, it may seem that Lewis has his work cut out for himself, since the events of the recent financial crisis are already well known.  More than that, lots of people have their minds made up concerning who the perps of the last few years are--banks and their aggressive managers, "shadow banks" and their even more aggressive managers, hedge funds, credit default swaps, mortgage brokers, the ratings agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Fed's monetary policy, various federal regulators, short sellers, politicians who over-pushed home ownership, a sensationalist media, the American public that overextending itself with excessive borrowing (or that lied in order to get home loans), housing speculators, etc.  The list goes on--and on.  Okay, so you already know this.  The defining aspect of this book, however, is that it asks (and answers) "Who knew?" about the impending financial crisis beforehand.  Who knew--before the financial crisis cracked open for everyone to see (and, perhaps, to panic) in the fall of 2008--that a silent crash in the bond market and real estate derivatives market was playing out?  Indeed, the good majority of this book addresses events that occurred before Lehman's failure in September of 2008.  In describing what led up to the darkest days of the crisis, Lewis does a good job helping the reader to see how the great financial storm developed.  All in all, this is an informative book.  Interestingly, in the book's prologue, Salomon Brothers alumnus Lewis explains how, after he wrote Liar's Poker over 20 years ago, he figured he had seen the height of financial folly.  However, even he was surprised by the much larger losses suffered in the recent crisis compared to the 1980s, which seem almost like child's play now.  For a taste of The Big Short, Steve Eisman was a blunt-spoken "specialty finance" research analyst at Oppenheimer and Co., originally in the 1990s, and he eventually helped train analyst Meredith Whitney, who most people associate with her string of negative reports on the banking industry, primarily from late 2007.  Giving a flavor of his style, Eisman claims that one of the best lines he wrote back in the early 1990s was, "The [XYZ] Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial institution--it loses money in every conceivable interest rate environment."  His own wife described him as being "not tactically rude--he's sincerely rude."  Vinny Daniel worked as a junior accountant in the 1990s (and eventually worked for Eisman), and he found out how complicated (and risky) Wall Street firms were when he tried to audit them.  He was one of the early analysts to notice the high default rates on manufactured home loans, which led to Eisman writing a 1997 report critical of subprime originators.  Michael Burry (later Dr. Michael Burry) was, among other things, a bond market researcher in 2004 who studied Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, and who correctly assessed the impact of "teaser rates" and interest rate re-sets on subprime loans.  In 2005, Burry wrote to his Scion Capital investors that, "Sometimes markets err big time."  How right he would be.  Greg Lippmann was a bond trader for Deutsche Bank, who discussed with Eisman ways to bet against the subprime mortgage market.  Before home prices declined, he noted, for example, that people whose homes appreciated 1 - 5% in value were four times more likely to default than those whose homes appreciated over 10%.  In other words, home prices didn't need to actually fall for problems to develop.  (Of course, home prices fell a lot.)  When Lippmann mentioned this to a Deutsche Bank colleague, he was called a Chicken Little.  To which, Lippmann retorted, "I'm short your house!"  He did this by buying credit default swaps on the BBB-rated tranches (slices) of subprime mortgage bonds.  If that's not a mouthful, read further in the book for a description of Goldman Sachs and "synthetic subprime mortgage bond-backed CDOs."  Then there's the AIG Financial Products story, told through the story of Gene Park, who worked at AIG, and his volatile boss, Joe Cassano.  Did I say this book is informative?  Here's a bit more:  Did you know that a pool of mortgages, each with a 615 FICO score, performs very differently (and better) than a pool of mortgages with half of the loans with a 550 FICO score and half with a 680 FICO score (for a 615 average)?  If you think about it, the 550/680 pool is apt to perform significantly worse, because more of the 550 FICO score loans develop problems.  Think about how that got gamed.  There's more, but hopefully you've gotten the point.  This is a very interesting, entertaining and informative book that accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Chances are you'll enjoy it. 
serious The LG600G is an excellent phone!    Transferring my minutes and phone number from my old TracFone was painless using Tracfone's website, and I didn't have to wait days for the transfer to be complete.  It was done just as soon as I was finished on their web page!!  Bluetooth works excellent!  I easily paired it with my GPS, earpiece,  and laptop.    I've been using it for a few days now, and have not experienced any dropped calls, always good connections.  The camera is very basic, but I already have a camera, and I didn't buy this for the camera.  It comes from Tracfone with free double minutes for life, and if you can afford to buy large blocks of minutes, Tracfone usually has good bonus minute deals.  So far, with the package I got through HSN, my costs have been less than $0.08 per minute!  Everyone I have spoken with over this phone say that my voice is nice and clear.  And they sound good to me!  All in all, the LG600G from Tracfone has been a very good deal for me!
serious This edition is an improvement over the theatrical release and is closer to the book.  My only disappointment related to this edition was that I opened the package to find a coupon for the ULTIMATE edition, which is to be released Decemberish.  The next (and I hope final) version will have the Black Freighter story woven into the main story as it is in the book.  If you don't want multiple versions of this film, hold off buying until the end of the year.  I agree with the other reviewers who note the film's ending is an improvement over the book's.  It just makes more sense in the context of the story.  This is not a knock on Mr. Moore, of whom I am a big fan.   I don't understand the folks who are so down on this film, unless it is that they just had the wrong expectations and/or didn't do their homework before watching it.  It was never meant to be another Spiderman, Superman or Hulk story.  Kudos to Mr. Moore.  Kudos for the team who produced this film.
serious I was looking for the perfect bag to carry my books and laptop at college, and this is it!  It's got a ton of pockets including room for a 15.4" laptop that straps securely in a padded pocket.  Even with the laptop in the bag you can fit books and notebooks with no problem.  I also carry around my AC adapter and a car charger with no worries.  It's got a hard shell on the bottom of the bag to protect your computer from damage if it's dropped.  You couldn't ask for more!
serious I've loved all three of Tori's books.  She is relatable (although living a very different life than most of us) and struggles with similar issues and conflicts as most women her age.  She is a great story teller who isn't afraid to share intimate moments.  At times I feel sorry for her, but also impressed that she has the courage to put it all out there.  I would read any book that Tori put her perfectionist, workaholic, creative, inspiring touches on - keep them coming!
serious The instructions with the package are really quite poor. They could do a better job at making sure you go to the video to see a demonstration. Fortunately I read enough reviews to know this ahead of time and installed the protectors without a problem. Didn't really see the point of the side protection pieces. I did put one piece on to protect from the dreaded antenna attenutation problems, but it made the stainless steel look dingy, so I took it off - wasn't having much antenna problem anyway.   The organge peel effect you get with this protector really detracts from the crispness of the iPhone 4 display. And I dislike the tacky feel this protector has - my fingers don't glide, they skid when I'm using the touch screen. I'll be ordering the Powersupport Crystal screen protector when it comes out. Had very good experience with it on my two previous iPhones. Might keet the ZAGG on the back where the tacky feel has some benefit; especially if the Powersupport doesn't come with a rear protector.
serious There were many reasons I decided to purchase a Kindle - my hands ache when holding a book open, I get headaches from reading stuff on the computer, I wanted something I could throw in a bag and take anywhere, and it holds so many items that I don't have to carry three or four novels with me in case I'm bored or finish one.  Nothing could prepare me for the actuality that is Kindle.  It integrated seamlessly into my life.  If I'm at the desk, it's beside me; if I'm in the bedroom, it's on the nightstand; I even take the silly thing to the john.  It's so much easier than a book.    I expected it to be a little awkward at first, but it really *does* get lost in your hands.  Suddenly, you look down after a couple of hours of reading, and realize you've been holding it all along and forgotten all about it.  I expected to read novels and blogs on it.  I never expected to be able to download all the .pdf technical manuals that I constantly have to weed through on the computer.  I work effortlessly now, looking at the computer, working through a segment, picking up the Kindle, searching for what I need in the manual, even highlighting it, or putting a note in the manual about how well it works.  Note taking is my big thing.  When I'm looking at a book, I always find note-taking to be an instinct I have to avoid.  I see it as a destructive process.  I don't want to ruin my books.  Further, who can really concentrate on what they're reading with a pen in their hand?  It's two different mindsets.  Yet, with Kindle, I do just that.  I read a segment, I find a passage, I underline it.  I have an opinion, I drop in a note.  A question equals another note.  When I don't understand something, the dictionary is right at the bottom of the screen to define the word or teach me how to pronounce it; or I can surf to the web and find exactly what I need.  It's so much better than surfing the web on my phone - and far more practical.  For one thing, there's no charge except battery power (no pun intended!).  For another, all of my research is in one place.  The book, notes, websites and highlights are all together - as they should be.  I know a lot of people complain that it should have a bright screen so that you can read it at night, or that it should have color.  I say - nay!  The main *strength* of Kindle is that it reads *exactly* like a book.  No eye strain.  No having to turn away every few minutes to relax your eyes; or ending a session of reading with a headache.  No "hot lap" or mousing around to find the right page.  It's just like a book.  You hold it, you turn the page, it's effortless, you forget it's there.  Only what you're reading matters, and that's exactly how it should be.
serious I purchased these through the fullbar website a few weeks back.  One, to see if they worked, two if they tasted good and three if other's found them helpful as well.  What I found is for me they are tasty and filling.  I then gave a few of my overweight patients some to try.  They found them to be very helpful.  The very overweight patients lost on average 2lbs+/wk for the last 3 weeks.  Normal weighted people, like myself, haven't lost in pounds, but I feel firmer as do they.  I am a massage therapist, so I am pretty muscular, but I would like to stay healthy and maintain normal eating habits so this bar is great for me for just that reason, but it does seem to help with weight loss as well.  I have tried all the flavors of these bars and they are all pretty tasty...No,they aren't horrid or dry, but they aren't snickers bars either.  Just a fine, not overly done flavor that does fill you up prior to eating.  I ate before lunch and dinner.  Smoothie for breakfast.    Just in case you are wondering the average Nutrition Facts on all the bars are: Total Fat 3g--- Sat. Fat 2g---Trans Fat 0g----Cholesterol 0mg---Sodium 105mg---Carbo's---31g---Fiber 4g----Sugars 13g---Protein 5g--- 
serious Klipsch is a recognized high quality name in home theater audio equipment, so I was very excited to receive this package. While, yes, you are not getting a blu-ray player with this system, you could expect to actually spend that $1000 retail price if you decided to purchase a system equal to this with a blu-ray player. As a secondary bedroom or even primary sound system, I found the quality to be superb for the price.   For a sub-$300 2.1 system this little guy really did well competing with our larger more expensive 5.1 Yamaha system. While the Yamaha will beat this system just because 5.1 will always sound better than 2.1, the sound from the speakers were crisper, clearer, and the subwoofer could nearly rattle the walls using it at full power. You still got the feeling of surround sound from this system.  For those who are not technologically inclined, this was not difficult at all to set up. I have had no problems with the DVD player thus far, and Klipsch has noted that they have fixed problems with a previous model.   If you're budget is under $300 and this is a second system for a smaller room or bedroom, I say go for it. If you have more to spend and this is going to be your main theater or living room sound system, I would look for a 5.1 or 7.1 system that you can hook a stand alone blu-ray player into.
serious I was looking for another edition of TESS and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the "average customer rating" was only three stars.  So I'm taking a moment to correct the balance. TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English.  It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero.  It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology.  It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth, as much with sex as with dirt, blood, milk, dung, animal and vegetative energies.  It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does.  It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes. The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident, every paragraph, reverberates throughout the whole structure.  Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work.  Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published, at first.  Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women, or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents.   The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of "Wessex" make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel, though the works don't otherwise bear comparison.  Melville's great white whale is a far punier creation. Hardy's style is like no one else's.  It is not snappy, as Dickens can be.  It is not fluid and elegant, like George Eliot's.  It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either.  It has no journalistic flavor, but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense, echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as "modern."  Don't start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, another very beautiful book, where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest.  Once you have the key to his style, then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes, e.g. Penguin, so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions.  Hardy's lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere.  The effect is not pretentious but timeless.   There is wisdom, poetry and majesty here.  Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience.  I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels, why we care about them, or what they are capable of, without reading this one.
serious I have been very entertained with this book since I was a child. This book is a very interesting and good read with lots of great situations from everyday life to the extremes.   This book is great for emergencies but it's also good for everyday reading. It contains a lot of useful information gathered from other books in the series. Not only will you read about dangerous situations, but you will also be able to read about social situations such as meeting your date's parents.   The facts in this book seem very logical. It's not made up and misleading information. The author of this book/series has put a lot of research into situations mentioned in the book(s). This book and its information is not a hard to read book at all. The wording is very simple for you to be able to actually remember some of the steps for situations. Everybody from ages 6 to 150 years of age will enjoy and love this book.  For $16 this book is a very good deal. If you look at the other series (there are a lot) and add up the cost for each one, they come out to a ridiculous amount. This book is a combination of all the books except the history edition. It doesn't have everything in it, but it has the BEST of the BEST worst case scenarios. The book is also very well designed. The yellow cover and simple titling really make it attractive. The hard cover also adds to the "wow" factor. It's a great book to show off to your friends/family.  For $16, you get an exciting read, amazing information, attractive book, and maybe your life! I recommend this book to anyone! It makes a great gift.
serious I've been using the TurboScratcher since it came out in the early 80s as a toy and scratching item for my cats.  I have NEVER paid for than about $12-13 for it, and the inserts used to be available from WalMart for 3/$9.  The catnip helps get the attention for the scratching part, and once the see how much fun it is to scratch, they rarely go back to carpet or furniture.  I've had more than one cat that never ONCE went for furniture because I made sure he/she had her own turbo-scratcher from the moment they arrived in my house.  I have one that is a light blue from back in the 80s when everything was light blue and mauve.  If left in the sun a bit too long, they do tend to get a little brittle, but while they feel a little flimsy, they are perfect for the cats.  For those without carpet -- use the rubber shelf or drawer liner cut in a square or circle a couple of inches bigger than the whole toy and it doesn't move at all.  I have never had any problem on any surface until I recently moved into a house with handscraped hardwood floors that are uneven.  This trick worked wonders there and I suspect it would have been more stable on the tile floor in our last house as well, but our cat like to sleep on it in the window in the sun just as much as playing or scratching it.  I recommend one to any cat that I adopt out at rescue, and for my foster babies, I give one to the family that adopts them because that's what I teach them to scratch on and I don't want them developing bad habits of scratching furniture or carpet in their new home -- where they are often trying to cope with the unfamiliar.  I've been told by my adoptive families that this was a really great thing to send esp since it was familiar and they were surprised at how much it was used.  Before replacing the cardboard circle, make sure you turn it over and use both sides!  if they seem a little bored and you are out of catnip, just pic up a little bag of it and it will totally get their attention again.
serious I bought this for hubby dear to keep warm when he plays his video games or while watching a movie. The throw is not as soft as I expected but it definitely makes up for that in terms of warmth. We really wish it were longer so we could snuggle in it together but it definitely is worth the price I paid for it ($12). My toddler started hogging the throw once she discovered how snuggly it felt and I bought her one for her very own, with which she is extremely pleased! It's the perfect size when used as a toddler blanket and she's kept very warm during cold Wisconsin winter nights.
serious I got this book because I wanted something that I could use to help teach my son his ABC's.  I bought it when he was about 15 months and immediately he enjoyed the book.  We would sing the song, read through the entire book, I'd point out the letters etc.  I find this book a very helpful starting point for learning the alphabet, a fun way!  One idea for younger toddlers, when I started we'd just read the letter and skip the other info on the page.  This way the book was more managable for my toddlers short attention span.  I have to say though, he really likes this book. Esp. when we first got it he'd literally sit down with the book and just flip through the pages.  A++
serious I loved this book.  Loved it.  I feel that it was very much in synch with Ms. Harris' earlier works in the series where the cohesion comes from a single mystery that runs like a river under the various plotlines (some resolved and some to be resolved).  Also unifying the whole, was the theme of 'family' which allowed us to get to know our favorite characters on a deeper level --really nice at this late stage in the series.  The character developement overall in this installment was spot on and brilliant (ie: Taking one of the series' new characters a full, believable, 180 degrees from sympathetic to psycho). Sookie is still our beloved Sookie, her black humor and sass intact, but now with some welcome maturation and self awareness (Take that Stephanie Plum!)and an ability to actually have some empathy and concern for Eric --oh, and now she will "stake a b***h" if you mess with her or her man! Speaking of whom, it's still our beloved Machiavellian Eric, but now he's realizing that he's got to be more open and honest if Sookie's going to trust him.    There's a return of the likable Bill for Bill fans. (Yay old Bill! Give him a woman he can mollycoddle and talk adorably stilted to for pity's sake.)  And even Sam was awesome and cool --his interactions with Sookie comforting and welcome instead of the yawn fest they've been lately.  It was also nice to have Jason back to being Sookie's big brother and comic relief rather than the absent ne'er do well.  The author was on her game with her descriptions and dialogue as well.  Some favorite quotes that come quickly to mind, "...he was not a happy camper.  Well, he could pitch his tent right alongside mine." and "That looks painful.  Would you like me to nurse it?" (Honestly, the book deserves 5 stars alone for the "chair" scene and Pam calling Sookie "monkey girl"  --too much wicked fun.)  I laughed aloud throughout the book.  Finally, there were a few "True Blood" shoutouts which I really enjoyed (and I include among these, a flipping of Eric's Maker storyline on it's head --way to own it, Ms. Harris, and give us something new along with a sly nod and a wink) and some clever references to past Sookie short stories --nice rewards for the faithful fan.   
serious I had wanted to learn to play the guitar after many failed attempts over the years.  This came up as a gold box deal, so I thought what the heck and ordered it, as I had seen many positive reviews of the eMedia software.  I received the package and it was *very* light.  I opened it up and laughed as it looked like a kids toy.  I decided that I better not waste my money and returned this kit and to go ahead and invest in a decent starter instrument (I bought a Seagull Coastline S6 Burst GT Guitar ).  I may go ahead and buy the standalone eMedia Guitar Method disc, but for now, I'm doing fine with the free lessons [...]
serious I give it 5 stars just for the simple fact that it does what it claims. If you use this as directed, you'll be very suprised. It's a little messy, I had to do 2 applications, took about a day and a half til I could go 'bandaid-less' without the paste. 1 actually came off yesterday (started the whole process 4 days ago) and the others definitely look like they are going to soon. It is a little painful & itchy (not to mention gross) but nothing awful. Those small round bandaids are perfect for this. I'll update this once they start to heal (the one that came off kind of looks like a little burn wound right now) and maybe I'll have during/after photos then. Also, it didn't really affect the healthy skin around it very much, and I know I wasn't very careful about applying it. Overall, it's worth the money. Careful about putting this in a place where others can see, it'll take a bit to heal and it turns the spot BLACK until it falls off. Wanted to also say the customer service is GREAT, the guy was super quick to reply to my emails and very nice/professional. I'll update in a few weeks!  update 3/27: All gone but a few holes/divots are left behind, not healed yet though and still red. Using neosporin and bandaids 24/7.  update 4/6: Divots have filled in, looking SO much better, just a bit red and discolored. Just started using prefer on scar treatment.  update 5/26: about half of the moles are starting to grow back (although smaller and flat). others are scars that lighten every week but still quite noticeable. will reapply to the ones reappearing.
serious I open this review with a very strong piece of advice: please listen to this album in its entirety.  Then come back to it within a day or two (or sooner, if you are so inclined) and give it a second listen from beginning to end.  If you do that, unless you really dislike "this kind of music", I'm relatively certain you will be enchanted with the album permanently.  Plastic Beach is truly an amazing work.  Keep the following thoughts in mind as you navigate through other reviews of Plastic Beach.  First, immediately discount any that express disillusion that this album is not the sequel to its stellar predecessor, Demon Days (2005).  Comparisons to Demon Days (and, by extension, the 2001 self-titled debut album) are useful to the extent they allow you to see how the Gorillaz sound has evolved over the course of a decade.  To truly appreciate this work fairly, however, you should judge it on the strength of its own merits.  Moreover, this review is being written the day of its United States release, and there are currently a handful of reviews that rate the album poorly.  These reviews seem to have a few things in common: they show very little regard to not only the craftsmanship and genius behind this work, but seem to be written from a jaded aspect that belies someone writing against a deadline and only taking time to listen to the album once (if they even listened that much).  That said, while this album isn't perfection personified, it really is quite good, easily earning a 9 out of 10 rating.  Below I will grade each track individually, but first I want to address the album as a whole.  Clocking in at just under an hour, this album is a cohesive whole that takes you on a sonic journey full of unlikely sights and stops along the way (often even within the individual songs themselves).  It's not surprising that this album in its formative stages was originally named "Carousel" by its loving architect, musical wizard Damon Albarn.  The album is a special kind of ride.  At times the album makes you think, but not too hard, because it doesn't purport to take a stand on any of the issues it brings to the surface.  Other times the album makes you want to sing along, but not too loudly, because you want to be able to appreciate the artistry at work in each song.  Most importantly, the album makes you feel emotion.  Whether it be exhilaration, abandon, wonderment, or disquiet, you feel it with force.    On to the snapshots of each song in the US track-list.  1) Orchestral Intro -- 4/5       This track lets you know you are headed somewhere important and maybe just a little bit different.  If you listen closely, the fade-out carries a hint of distortion, which I take as an indication that the nature you are about to experience is quite unnatural.  2) Welcome to The World of The Plastic Beach -- 3/5       There's probably no truer living representation of hip-hop than Snoop Dogg, and he serves as an apropos master of ceremonies welcoming you to your destination.  Snoop has always had a unique five-star flow, and it's on full display on this track.  Ever since his debut album Doggystyle (1993), however, he has an uneven track-record of bringing the heat to whatever song he's spitting rhymes on.  The frustrating thing about Snoop is that both the listener and he are in on the fact that many times he is as lazy a lyricist as the flow of his trademark delivery, and that is indeed the case in this song, using trite expressions like "Boss Dogg" (not once, but twice), "mirror, mirror on the wall" and "crack-a-lackin".  For the record, my wife thinks that Snoop did exactly what he was supposed to do on this track: introduce, not steal the stage.  Regardless, aided by the sick horns of the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, this song helps get you in the mood to groove.  3) White Flag -- 3/5       A light, flighty orchestral piece by the Lebanese National Orchestra For Oriental and Arabic Music (I think I got that right...) takes you to Bollywood and some other exotic places you've probably never been to as you skip across the sand of Plastic Beach for the first time.  You are suddenly greeted by a hot potato back-and-forth rap between British grime rap stars Kano and Bashy set to a dub beat.  Their wordplay forms the musical meat sandwiched between the previously mentioned beginning of the track and its conclusion, which is a synthesis of the orchestral part and the dub beat.  The final outcome is both an unlikely treat and treatise from your locale.  4) Rhinestone Eyes -- 5/5       This song has video single written all over it.  2D's vocals take center stage for the first time.  It's a heavily synthesized pop tune complete with catchy not-quite-a-chorus repeats of the phrase "Love Electric-tric-tric-tric-tric" that you can only imagine yourself chanting alongside Noodle.  This song also carries that signature "Gorillaz sound" of keyboards and drumbeats that can be traced back to their debut album.  This song is definitely one of the reasons I regard the album so highly.  5) Stylo -- 5/5       The lead single and video from the album.  "Feel Good, Inc." it is not, but this fact only adds to "Stylo"'s charm.  An unyielding beat accentuated by an insidious, haunting repetition of the phrase "Overload", a slick verse from Mos Def, and the undeniable raw power of Bobby Womack make this song an instant classic.  You don't get "Stylo" at first, you just know it has a catchy beat.  After multiple listens, though, you realize the song is consummate.  It is worth mentioning that essential to the whole Gorillaz concept is the fact that their music is both an audio and visual experience.  Taken in that light, the promotional video shot for this track by co-creator Jaime Hewlett does an excellent job of immediately engaging the audience and drawing them into Plastic Beach.   6) Superfast Jellyfish -- 4/5       Rumored to be the second video and single from the album, this song is dripping with sinister irony.  De La Soul become the first rap artists to score a follow-up opportunity with the Gorillaz, and they do not disappoint in this twisted indictment of consumerism, cloaked in a breakfast meal jingle.  Though not as in-your-face and extreme as, say, Johnathan Swift's 1729 pamphlet "A Modest Proposal" the implications of this song are meant to be frightening.  Gruff Rhys also lends his vocals to the track that is both scary and scary good.    7) Empire Ants -- 5/5       The beautiful, peaceful beginning of this song shows Plastic Beach at its most serene.  The guitar makes a rare appearance, and it strums blissfully along in concert with 2D's singing and piano accompaniment.  Then, halfway through, the song it improbably explodes into a shimmering disco-pop tune completed by the vocals of Yukumi Nagano from the Swedish group, Little Dragon.  This may very well be the album's best song, though "Broken" gives it a serious run for its money a few songs later.  8) Glitter Freeze -- 2/5       Personal preference here, but this is my least favorite song of the lot.  Mostly instrumental with a few sparse words from curmudgeon Mark E Smith, this song is an aural assault on your eardrums and mind.  Often, after this song ends, I'm relieved, because it feels like I've just been willingly violated, which might just be a microcosm for one of the tenets of the album, namely the willful violation of our own home planet.  But just as soon as you begin to contemplate that we are off to our next song.  9) Some Kind of Nature -- 3/5       Many are split on this Lou Reed guest effort, where his sing-song voice takes Albarn's piano-based beatnik ditty for a quick spin.  Some hail it as the watermark of Plastic Beach, while others decry it as its nadir.  The song comes pre-loaded with a fully realized chorus and simulated clapping that beckons singing along.  I'm still not sure what to make of it all, I find myself in neither of the previously mentioned camps of supporters or naysayers, but I believe it is a solid addition to the album regardless.  10) On Melancholy Hill -- 5/5       An endearing track.  Listen closely and you'll hear a rhythm that lies beneath Coldplay's "Viva La Vida" and the song it borrowed heavily from "Foreigner Suite" by Cat Stevens.  I doubt it is intentional, and it is otherwise completely overshadowed by what is quite an uncharacteristically upbeat, almost saccharine ode from Albarn.  While this song is technically 2D from Gorillaz, it is also every bit just Damon being himself.  11) Broken -- 5/5       My favorite of the album.  The song evokes Clint Eastwood with its pseudo-riff on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" theme by Hugo Montenegro.  The song is beyond phenomenal, and I think this is no coincidence, another 2D solo joint that can just as easily be seen as Damon Albarn as himself.  The beat is seriously sick and haunting at the same time.  The production sounds as if lifted off a top-flight hip-hop producer's private instrumental songbook, but it is so much more due to Damon's vocals dominating the song.  I don't care what he is singing about in this song, I just want to listen and feel his lament.  It's why this album, and its creator, are one-of-a-kind.  12) Sweepstakes -- 4/5       Hated this song at first, due to the repetition of the beat and the rhyme.  However, keep listening: the lyrics actually change, not in their content, but in their delivery, just as the song itself transforms into something greater than the sum of its parts.  Several minutes of repetition in, you are greeted again by the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble amplified this time with a percussion section that evokes an American college football halftime band performance.  Mos Def is most definitely a winner on this track.  Hip-hop heads will prefer this track to the rest of the album's offerings, which speaks to the fact that there is almost something for everyone here.  13) Plastic Beach -- 3/5       I can't hear Mick Jones' contribution to this song, but ex-Clash band-mate (and frequent Albarn-collaborator) Paul Simonon's strings sound pretty good on the title track.  The track is funky, a little bit eerie, and definitely keeps the mood of the album and its maybe-fictional-maybe-real setting at the center of your mind as your trek through Plastic Beach nears its end.  14) To Binge -- 5/5       For those not expecting Blur to ever make a guest appearance on this album -- well, don't worry, they didn't.  But this is as close as you'll ever get, since even the most casual Gorillaz fan will notice that 2D doesn't sound anything like himself on this record.  In fact, he sounds just like Albarn from Blur during the height of the 90s Britpop era.  This time, however, he is trading verses with guest singer Yukumi Nagano who appears in her second contribution to the album.  The song is like a fading sunset, with clouds developing as the song itself fades out.  If this is the final album from the Gorillaz, I think this song serves as its official good-bye.  And even though two more tracks come after this one, they feel more like encores than anything.  15) On The Cloud of Unknowing -- 4/5       But what encores they are!  Powerful, powerful stuff from Bobby Womack here, coupled with chilling and atmospheric instrumentation from Sinfonia ViVA, make this a contemplative song, even if the first few listens give little clue as to what you and singer are contemplating.  It can be simply described as a pretty song.  16) Pirate Jet -- 4/5       I have an image of an animated pogo-stick or slinky, or something bouncy like that just hopping all over this song like a little kid.  "It's all good news now, because we left the taps running for a hundred years."  Call it tongue-wagging sarcastic optimism at the prospect that even as foolish and wasteful we humans are, Nature will adapt to whatever is thrown at it, and persevere.  That's my take, at least.  And with that, the final opus in the Gorillaz trilogy (this is widely rumored to be the final album for the group) comes to a close.  If you have made it to the end of this review, thank you.  I had fun sharing my rambling thoughts on what I feel is a great album.  If you have not already purchased this album, give it a try, you will be happy you did.
serious Firefly was a show that came on the heels of Fox's usual brilliant decision-making--right after it cancelled my beloved Dark Angel.  I first thought this show would be awful, but I sat down and watched it--and it was love.  Truly.  It's rare to find a show that can be taken seriously that also made me laugh out loud in every episode.  The writing was extraordinary, and the actors/actresses were absolute gold.  It was really like watching a movie each time around.  Yet again, Fox shot itself in the foot and iced another good show.  Nonetheless, at least the DVD is soon to come.  At least they had the decency to do that.  Come on, sing it with me: "Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand.  But I don't care--I'm still free.  You can't take the skies from me..."
serious I've tracked through this disc a bunch of times now - It just keeps getting better with each listen. It didn't take long to realize "Fallen" was going to make its way into my rotation of discs I listen to a lot. I found myself anxiously waiting to hear what came next while listening to it, which rarely happens. Their music is hauntingly dark, and beautiful at the same time, and it does have its "rock" moments, thanks to some really nice guitar sounds. And I *love* Amy's voice! The production is huge sounding; the songs are beautifully textured with keyboards, strings and layered back up vocals. This is not a 'rap-metal' band, if you've only heard the "Bring Me To Life" single. There's a lot of depth to this group that you might not be expecting to hear ... and a lot of interesting things going on. Definitely not a "throw on at a party" CD - But one that I find myself wanting to explore beginning to end, again and again. Besides the lead single, I really like "Tourniquet", "Going Under", "Haunted", "My Immortal", "Whisper" and "My Last Breath." The rest of the songs are also very good ... totally worth picking up, and hopefully an indication of more brilliance to come. Awesome stuff - a CD that's worth your attention.
serious The lipstick is very intense in color. So choose a color that is a little lighter than you would normally wear. It takes some time to learn how to apply the lip color.  1. put on a single light coat quickly   2. let dry for one or two minutes  3. Do not rub your lip together until you apply the clear balm.  4. to remove use simple chapstick or Vaseline  Tip: You can use maybelline's Shine Seduction Lip Gloss on top of the superstay if you want the look of a lip-gloss but with more staying power. 
serious My mother bequeathed her 1962 college edition hardcover to me in 1988, four years after I finished high school. It would be four more years before I myself went away to school, though I knew the story nearly by heart by then.   I reread Mockingbird every year at Eastertime, though I am not particularly religious, nor do I mark this time in any other particularly hopeful way. Many true bibliophiles I know still talk about this book and the way it changed them forever.  It deserves better than to be assigned reading to captive 6th and 10th graders. They read it then because they have to, not because some kind librarian or insightful teacher, or intuitive parent, sends it their way, like a lucky charm.  I am not a Southerner and unless you can call a Western New York born mother and an Owensboro, Kentucky bred father any sort of meaningful Southern influence in my life, I do not know why this story fits my life so well. It filled a need I never even knew was there until I closed its covers on first reading it.   I am a fan of both the writing and its message, its dual edged sword of hope and sorrow, the tragicomic aspect of its mood and setting.   I wanted to be Scout as a tomboy girl and when grown, to be Atticus; my cats have borne those monikers well.   I only wish my husband had not told me I could not name my own son after my hero.   A rare case where the movie and its inspiration are as beloved as its author, To Kill a Mockingbird, N words and all, needs to be read more---and not just as some lame excuse for a paper writing exercise. Scout, Jem and Dill come alive in these pages. They have meaning in their world and in this one.  The dialogue, minus a few colloquiallisms, is readable and real. You will laugh out loud at times when Scout makes her mind known to you.  You'll wish Atticus was a real man. Maybe you'll even feel a little guilty about wanting him to replace your father in real life.  And Tom Robinson? He'll break your heart. He should.  I was once told my Coleman family had some relation to Harper Lee's father's family and, if that bit of fiction has even the remotest grain of truth to it, I am even happier now than I was just having imagined it.   PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. 
serious When I do not feel like carrying my heavy SLR camera and lenses, I take my Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 instead.  With the 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, the G1 is about one-third the weight of my Sony A900 SLR with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens.  Of course, the G1's 12 megapixel sensor cannot compete with the A900's 24 megapixel sensor, and the 14-45 lens is neither as fast as, nor of equal quality to, the 24-70 lens, but the portability of the G1 means that I take it with me more often than I take my A900.  The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 Digital Camera Case Gadget Bag  fits the G1 with 14-45 lens perfectly and attaches to my belt via a Velcro strap.  And the Canon WS20 Wrist Strap for all Canon Camcorders  is a convenient alternative if you don't want a camera strap around your neck.  If I were to list all of the features of the G1 that I like, this review would be rather long, so here is a short list of my favorite features:  1. All of the buttons that control focus, metering, ISO, etc. are well positioned and easy to use.  2. A real time histogram may be displayed if desired.  3. In manual focus mode, the image is magnified in the high resolution electronic viewfinder so that precise focus may be achieved.  4. If desired, images may be stored in RAW (RW2) format in addition to the limiting JPEG format.  The RAW alternative allows for better noise suppression (see below).  A consequence of the small 14-45 lens is that the lens is not particularly fast and so does not permit low light photography.  However, the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras  remedies this problem.  Also available are the Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0 Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic Digital SLR Cameras  and Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic and Olympus Micro Four Thirds Cameras  lenses that extend the zoom range to 14-400mm (35mm equivalent).  And the camera plus all four lenses weigh a mere four pounds, so can easily be taken along on a hike.  For those who would like to capture video, the Panasonic DMC-GH1 12MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video , Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-45mm Lens  and the somewhat larger Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD  are attractive alternatives.  But I don't shoot video, so the G1 is a low priced solution to my need for a portable camera.  The two weaknesses of the Panasonic G1 are:  1. The dynamic range of the sensor is a bit limited, with the consequence that it is fairly easy to blow out the highlights in an image.  I haven't found a good solution to this problem, other than to shoot in RAW mode and underexpose at bit when I want to capture cloud detail.  2. The sensor introduces a fair amount of noise above ISO 800.  However, this problem is nicely remedied if one shoots in RAW mode and uses Adobe Lightroom 3 to suppress noise.  This approach easily extends the useful ISO from 800 to 1600, and in some cases to 3200.  Update: Panasonic has recently introduced the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G2 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-Inch Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Lumix G VARIO f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens (Black)  and Panasonic Lumix DMC-G10 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 14-42mm Lumix G Vario f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens  cameras.  Both of these cameras can record video.  Also, it appears that the Sony Alpha NEX-3 and NEX-5 cameras, with their APS-C sensors, provide better image quality than any of the Panasonic cameras.  However, as of this writing, the Sony system does not provide as broad a zoom range as does the Panasonic system.

serious Though I do not follow golf, it was hard not pay attention to Tiger. Naturally, I was left shaking my head with everyone else, wondering what drove someone so disciplined to make such a mess of his life. Steve Helling's book answers some of those questions, though it would be impossible to answer all of them. It is not a book of sensationalism or speculation, but well-written journalism that give us an inside look at both the life and the downfall of a paragon who never asked to be placed on the pedestal on which the world displayed him.  This book follows the clues that tell us some of what makes Tiger Woods who he is, starting with the breadcrumbs that were dropped long before his birth. While a bemused public looked on as a toddler putted against Bob Hope, not one of them could have predicted that that same child would grow to be not only the world's greatest golfer, but also a hero and role model with such a carefully constructed persona that even his handlers would forget that a real person lay behind the smoke and mirrors. Tiger Woods was not a god, but an unforgiving public would punish him for not acting like one.  While he is responsible for his mistakes, one can't help but wonder who Tiger would have been had he been allowed to be Tiger Woods rather than a meticulously crafted ideal.     
serious Ann's books is an excellent portrayal of the liberal bias in the American media that is constantly promoting immoral, irresponsible, irrelevant people and ideas that are harmful to the future survival of this nation. Coulter's book can be described as nothing more than brillant and should be in the hands of every journalism student in America, so that they will not fall into the trap of subjective liberal ideology.
serious The Clash of the Titans remake is not as bad as some are saying and the movie is quite enjoyable, I think in 2D or even on DVD it would have been a lot better. I love the new 3D digital movies that are being made at the moment but this was a real mess. I understand that it wasn't shot in 3D and was therefore converted afterwards, what were they thinking about ? The picture was awful and in most scenes it looked as though someone was standing behind the main actors. After seeing the true 3D magic of Avatar I was really disappointed. I think I will purchase it on DVD and hopefully the picture will look better on my 42in screen that it did in the cinema. I don't think I would watch a converted 3D movie again as it just cheapens the expierence. I would have given it 4 stars but the let down of the 3D only rates it 3 stars.
serious $10/month for 3G Data plan, decent internet speed, GPS, this phone rocks!  You can simple install the PCSuite that can be downloaded from Nokia site and use it as modem. I use this to hook up to my laptop for unlimited data download and upload. It work extremely well with my cisco VPN client to remote desktop my work computer at the office. I don't have to paid $10/24hr to the hotel in Vegas anymore!
serious I order this product after pre-ordering my iPhone 4 on June 15th.  It was the only case I could find that seems to readily availble to ship from the merchant.  Received the item promptly just a few days before the phone arrived.  It included a front screen protector and a cleaning cloth.    The fit is pretty accurate and serves the purpose for protecting the sides and back of the phone considering it was likely manufactuered with limited specs available for the iPhone 4.  My only complaint is with the finish - there is a raised seam all the way around the sides (and over the round volume buttons) where it's aparent the two halves the of the case were fused together or the injection mold wasn't cut properly. And the edges of the open cutouts for the headphone, mute button, dock connector, etc has a similar yet smaller lip around the openings.  A minor complaint with the screen protector that it has that "rainbow" or oily look to it when held at an angle to the room light when the phone is off or on standby.  But viewing the phone directly you can't see it.  But for my needs - having a case and screen protector available for the day I got my phone for a inexpensive price - this case meets my needs.  I plan to replace it in the future as other product become available and use this case as a back up.  (Pictures of the seams coming soon)
serious I bought my X11s to improve my gameplay in Modern Warfare 2 and to play at night while my family is asleep. I am so glad that I did. They have accomplished both objectives with flying colors. The sound quality is excellent. I can hear absolutely everything, even the faintest sound cues I could never hear before. Just the ability to hear footsteps, the direction that they are coming and what they are walking on makes all the difference in multiplayer. Before ordering them, I read many reviews that mention a hiss when the headset is plugged in and was a bit worried that this might be an issue. There is a hiss, but it is so negligible that it isn't even worth listing as a con. Almost all the other reviews that I've read that mention this hiss also mention that you can't even hear it during gameplay. Doesn't that pretty much disqualify it as a con? Honestly, these things could play Home On The Range until I put my MW2 disc in the drive for all I care. There has to be absolute silence in the game in order to hear the hiss. As soon as any music or in game action starts, it is gone, in no way hindering your gaming experience. I also didn't have any problem hearing this hiss while using the X11s with my iPhone for music or YouTube. The ability to control both the game and chat volumes works very well. I've played several very long MW2 multiplayer sessions with friends and I haven't had any issues with my friends hearing me or vice versa. I love that when you raise the game volume, it automatically adjusts the chat volume so that the game audio doesn't drown it out. Which is a good thing, because these bad boys are loud as hell when you crank them up. I have literally jumped in my seat during unexpected explosions. The volume and quality of the sounds make for a very immersive gaming experience.  They are also extremely comfortable. Most of the time, I can barely tell they are there, even when I've had them on hours at a time. My old headset sat right on my ears, which would make my ears very sore, very quickly. Overall, I have to give these a five out of five. For the price, they just can't be beat.
serious Here is this product's obligatory page-long review.  I drew some basic comparisons to two other Verizon phones -- the Samsung Omnia i910 and the LG Dare.  I hope this review may ultimately save some of you some time. :)  I have been looking for a phone with a high-resolution, fast camera, and PDA-like features.  I use the camera when traveling to clients' premises, and am surprised how many devices made by Apple, RIMM, Palm and others treat cell-phone cameras as an adolescent feature that wastes the time of employees (like surfing emails and internet cannot be abused this way).  As someone who needs the coverage of the Verizon network in my area, not too many phones fit into the above two categories -- particularly without the need to buy a $30/month data plan.  I intentionally delayed using my NE2, knowing that Verizon often releases phones in June.  After nearly choosing the Samsung Omnia i910 and LG Dare, I'm glad I did.  I read in other Amazon reviews that some user's of the Sammy 910 made the effort to set the phone up properly so that they didn't have to dig through menus.  But personally, I found the i910 very difficult to do almost anything, even with shortcuts right on its desktop, even after trying it out 6 times at Verizon stores.  I'd hate to tell a relative, "Here's my phone, go make a call!"  It's excellent 5mpix camera almost convinced me, but it was too hard to text in either landscape or portrait, and it requires the $30/mon data plan, plus has a non-standard headphone jack.  The LG Dare was much simpler to pick-up an use, although (without having tried calibration adjustments) I found I made mistakes every time I did a sample text message with it's touch screen, in either orientation.  The camera was also slow at times, especially when using auto-focus, taking as much as 2 seconds to take a picture, and more to wait for the camera to prompt you with the save/erase options.  Enter the enV Touch (and in some similar respects, the LG enV3 VX9200 Phone, Blue (Verizon Wireless)  or the LG enV3 VX9200 Phone, Maroon (Verizon Wireless) .  Finally, a company has figured out a way to keep a real, non-touch-screen qwerty board embedded in an updated, semi-smart phone, especially for those of us who cannot or do not like haptic-feedback touch screens.  Personally, I prefer the center-located space bar, although some of the older enV user's may need time to get used to this.  The keyboard, with my fairly large, iron-grip hands, is easier to use than any touch screen keyboard I've tried, and the 3.2 megapixel camera is one of only a few Verizon phones that offers better than 3 megapix resolution -- shameful in my opinion.  Pictures snap quickly too, in less than 1 second.  The full 3" screen viewfinder makes you feel as if you are using a devoted still camera, although I'm noticing that I have to be a bit careful how I hold the phone so as not to cover the sensor.  This will improve with practice.  But about that front touchscreen -- I am very impressed.  Even without a hard keyboard, this would have been the first phone from any US provider where I can actually type out a text message, completely error-free, using only the traditional numeric keypad in portrait mode.  And getting there is easier too -- the tab-up feature to use the touch screen is very easy and intuitive.  Screen resolution is very good, though perhaps not quite as leading edge as the iPhone or Storm color and resolution.  However, the screen is large enough to see the touch keyboard and a large enough portion of a text or email message without having to scroll through as much as with the Dare/Omnia.  But the phone is also fast -- my old Motorola motorazr had ongoing slow-responsiveness to pictures, notepad activation, even ringing for incoming calls!  The enV Touch is fastest phone I've used, with a near-instant 1/4th second or better response to opening or activating almost anything.  This iPhone-like device also does not require a data plan if you just need a feature-rich cell phone without always-on email.  However, at $1.99/MB, I will have to try out email push and browsing to see if a data plan may yet be desirable.  I travel to Canada frequently, and hope not to have any "always-on" data roaming fees -- I have read horror stories about iPhones incurring $600 bills as owners blithely cross borders or even roaming within the US.  But to my current, possibly wrong understanding, I don't think this phone automatically data-roams.  The phone also offers airplane mode and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack -- finally, no more need to take an iPod and cell phone and camera with me on trips.  Now only if we had unlocked GPS...maybe this will work with Google Maps?  Another interesting device I'm looking at purchasing is the Motorola MOTOROKR T505 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone  which blue-tooths the phone's audio or phone calls to the car stereo -- safer for calls and convenient for music.  Another nice change:  The CLEAR and END keys on the front screen are well separated now -- no accidentally erasing an unsent message when you thought you were backspacing.  It's not perfect.  Despite the terrific 16GB capacity, Verizon's menu system still retains a 200 text-message limit.  Wha??  After nearly 10 years with this design, couldn't this be a tiny bit larger by now?   Of course, that's a Verizon issue, not really LG's mistake, but since this phone is currently only used on Verizon's network, it's an issue.  The phone is a little bit wider at .61 inches than comparable, non-keyboarded competitors.  I gladly accept this trade-off for the convenience of two styles of keyboards though.  It's also little taller than the similar enV3.  So far, that's all I can say on the con side.  As much as I love the touch screen, it's still not what I'd consider a true iPhone contender though, which with a new release today, seems like it still has a more vibrant display and of course much better apps.  But the enV Touch was, for me, the closest Verizon phone to the iPhone, if only because it seems so intuitive, and it is easily the best cell phone I've ever owned.  As I use the phone, I will update the review with notable pros and cons.
serious Spaceballs is perhaps the best Sci-fi spoof of all time. It has already been mentioned that it spoofs Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, but it really spoofs nearly every big Sci-fi movie ever. Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey (&quot;...they've gone to plaid!&quot;) and many more. Some of the best sequences are the &quot;ludicruous speed&quot; scene, the &quot;instant video&quot; scene, and the whole Yogurt part. Mel Brooks plays the spoof of Star Wars' Yoda who is the guardian of the Schwartz and is also heavily into Spaceballs Merchandising, including the Spaceballs flamethrower. (&quot;The kids love this one.&quot;) Rick Moranis, of course, is the Darth Vader spoof, and I have to congradulate the casting department, because Rick Moranis and Darth Vader have to be as close to being polar opposites as you can come. Although I have heard it called unfunny and lame by others, I think it is a very funny movie and deserves to be watched not only by Sci-fi fans, but by anybody looking for a good laugh.
serious Although "Deep Impact" invariably gets compared to "Armageddon", I think it's more appropriate to compare it against all other disaster movies. Viewed in that light, it not only surpasses "Armageddon", but every other film in the genre.  Unlike most disaster epics, "Deep Impact" is character driven. I think this is a direct effect of its having been directed by a woman rather than a man. While the special effects are there and are impressive, what drives this film are the emotions of the excellent ensemble cast. All of them ring true, from the occasional duplicitousness of the government bureaucrats, to the real tear jerking moments of those facing tough life and death decisions, to the small intimate moments. It's powerful enough stuff that I have to believe that a lot of the negative reaction the film elicited vis-a-vis "Armageddon" came from guys who don't like their action movies to move them to the verge of tears in public.  All disaster films depend on a hook to set them up. In this respect, most fall far short of realism and believability. Of ones that come immediately to mind, only the cosmic collision movies and "The Towering Inferno" had realistic setups.  All disaster films depend on the heros to come up with some way to save the day. Of the ones with a believable setup, many still fall short of believable and/or technically accurate resolutions. This is where "Armageddon" failed miserably. Mimi Leder had expert advice from NASA and it shows. "Armageddon" has some impressive training facilities shots from NASA, but ignored the actual technology. Very early in "Armageddon", when I saw the two shuttles docking with the space station by coming in from opposite directions, performing clearly aerodynamic banking maneuvers, I was ready to start pelting the screen with rotten tomatoes!  Giving the devil his due, both films glossed over the full impact of operations in the microgravity environment of the comet's surface.  Still, it's the raw emotions that elevate "Deep Impact" above its genre, not just the technical stuff. It's actually best in its quiet moments. Among the ones that clearly stand out:  The president (Morgan Freeman) tries to continue to maintain an upbeat message as each plan successively fails. His press conferences and the dialog around them rings true.  The dialog between the reporter (the usually annoying Tea Leoni) and her mother (Vanessa Redgrave) also rings with truth.  The ultimate reconciliation between the reporter and her father (Maximilian Schell) just before the end reflects the bitterness of choices each has made in getting to that point.  The reunion of the kid who helped discover the comet (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), oblivious for the moment to what was going on around them - again, this simply rings true.  The astronaut observing wryly, "Well, the good news is that we'll all have high schools named after us." No melodramatics, no macho heroism, just someone injecting a sense of humor into a shared fate she has accepted as necessary to save the people they love. My favorite line in the film.  From start to finish, this film is a class act. A realistic film that carries an emotional impact to be expected of its serious subject matter. Part of this impact is that you can't always guess in advance which characters will and will not survive. Of the ones who don't survive, not all face their fate gracefully, but all are believable.  This movie began my fandom of Mimi Leder, who I consider to be one of the best directors working today - not always commercial, but always excellent. This is on my short list of my top ten favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended!
serious Mine is utilized for robotics projects--it finds a lot of uses with metal.  I also bought the press accessory with it.  This little accessory helps me make straight cuts and drill holes. I'm telling you, I use this thing constantly and it works like a champ!  It is powerful enough for me to cut all my brass and aluminum with the precision of that of a doctor.  For as handy as this tool is--I'd pay twice as much to get one if need be.  I've had mine for 5 months too. One HUGE word of advice.  WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES!  I know this may sound lame, but it saved my @ss!!!  When cutting some tubing, my disk exploded at full RPM's and the shrapnel hit me in the goggles.  (Of course I had my fat head over top of it while I was cutting)  Just be careful.  The tool is A+, but the little thing could be dangerous if you slack on the safety.
serious This phone is hard-to-find-common-sense approach in design and technology. I have never seen better phone.  This is not a gadget that makes your life miserable because you need to worry every day that batteries are charged or you need to spend 1/2 day on setup or figuring out why current  time does not show on screen. If you need features behind phone, get Apple iPhone if you need just a cell phone, get Motorola F3.
serious This gift is perfect for anyone.  After all, bacon is the world's perfect accessory meat.  I gave these as stocking stuffers at my family Christmas, and they were THE favorite item.  Looks delicious and is functional.
serious The King James Version of the Bible (a.k.a. the Authorized Version) is an English translation of the Bible published in 1611.  Commissioned by King James I of England, 54 scholars were approved by the king of whom 47 labored in six groups at three locations for seven years making use of both texts in the original languages and previous English translations.  The result was a translation that had a marked influence on English style and literature because of its flowing language and prose rhythm, and was generally accepted as the standard English Bible for more than three centuries.  When I was teaching A.P. English I strongly recommended to my students that the two supplemental texts they should have for class should be a copy of the King James Version of the Bible with a good concordance, and Edith Hamilton's "Mythology."  Of course in the age of searchable on-line texts such suggestions are of less value, but the religious and mythical allusions that appear in the works of Dante, Shakespeare, Milton and many other writers (not to mention politicians such as Lincoln), cannot readily understood unless you recognize them.  Just in the first 11 chapters of Genesis we have two creation stories, the fall, the story of Cain and Abel, the flood, and the tower of Babel.  All of these are major touchstone is contemporary literature.  What is the biggest money making movie of all-time but a retelling of the story of the tower of Babel turned into the arrogance of the construction of a ship that supposedly not even God could sink?  As for our willingness to accept different versions of the same tale, I can argue that comes primarily from our reading of the four Gospels since billions more have done that then read the three extant Greek tragedies on the slaying of Clytemnestra by Orestes (which everyone should also still be reading as literature).  However, over the years I increasingly faced objections from students who felt that using the Bible as a reference book, or studying it as literature, was a waste of time since the Bible was not "true" (as near as I can tell the distinction between "true" and "True" is not germane to their position).  Of course, they failed to appreciate the irony that they were making this argument in a course devoted to studying the various forms of fiction.  But the book of Job is a didactic poem set in a prose framing device, which to me indicates it is a lesson rather than a true story and suggests it can be considered an extant fictional narrative (if not outright drama) contemporary to the time of the great tragic poets in Athens.  One that gets in the door as "legitimate" literature, the rest of the books of the Bible deserve the same consideration.  To the extent that the Bible contains a coherent system of symbols, presents a tightly unified set of controlling themes, and explores the fundamental questions of human existence it functions as literature, without sacrificing its theological import.  Ancient history has long been treated as literature of a kind, songs have always been considered poetic, and epistolary writing counts too.  It should be kept in mind that while the Bible can be considered as literature as well as sacred writing there is also value in using the critical techniques of literature to read the Bible as scripture as well.  The Bible is also important to the study of comparative religion, history, archeology, cultural anthropology, and other studies of the human condition.   Most importantly, when it comes down to reading the Bible as literature there can really be no other choice than the King James Version.  The eminence of this translation has been codified by such diverse entries as "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations," which use the KJV as the source for all Bible quotations, and the character Linus in "A Charlie Brown Christmas," use recites the story of the nativity from the KJV version of the 2nd chapter of Luke.  At least to those of us who are Baby Boomers, this is the way the Bible should sound and the black imitation leather cover is appropriately old school as well.
serious Who would buy this piece of trash?  Because, if you hadn't already noticed, it now comes in SLEEVELESS format.   Sleeves are for wimps.   Please, do yourself a favor and grow a pair and surf on over to the sleeveless offering now.   Because in order to do TRUE collatoral damage, you must have the guns exposed.  KAPOW!
serious The Culture Warrior by Blll O'Reilly provides a reader with powerful principals for change. It is the first book I have read by O'Reilly and have found his writing to be pleasant.  I found this book to be enjoyable as it describes the most effective people should be value centered, which is the key for long term success.  The book went on to describe where people are dependent and need others to get what they want while independent people can get what they want by their own effort.  The paradigms presented in the Culture Warrior by O'Reilly can assist individuals in their professional work and more importantly in their personal lives. I give this book a thumbs up and a must read.
serious Life is far from normal for Bella Swan during her senior year of high school. True, her life is full of drama and boy troubles, but for Bella who sees herself as a danger magnet life holds much much more. Edward Cullen, her ever-handsome boyfriend who just happens to be a vampire, breaks her heart when he leaves after Bella receives a near-fatal paper cut at her eighteenth birthday party. Realizing that his family no matter how determined to avoid human blood, can within seconds be overwhelmed with tempation and violence leads him to place Bella's safety ahead of his own desires. To say that Bella is devastated is an understatment, she becomes zombie-like in her loss, a fact which is finally realized when Bella and one of her friends are watching a Zombie movie. "It wasn't until almost the very end, as I watched a haggard zombie shambling after the last shrieking survivor, that I realized what the problem was. The scene kept cutting between the horrified face of the heroine, and the dead emotionless face of her pursuer, back and forth as it closed the distance. And I realized which one resembled me the most. . . But it was ironic, all things considered, that, in the end, I would wind up a zombie. I hadn't seen that one coming. Not that I hadn't dreamed of becoming a mythical monster once--just never a grotesque, animated corpse. . . It was depressing to realize that I wasn't the heroine anymore, that my story was over." (106) But Bella's story is far from over. Reintroduce into the picture, Jacob Black, the young man who first shared with Bella the fact that she was falling in love with a vampire, this new friendship reenergizes Bella's existence and gives her a reason to continue on. But is her friendship with Jacob any safer for her than her relationship with Edward was? Or is Jacob hiding a dangerous secret of his own? Is Edward out of the picture for good, or will he make a comeback to try to reclaim her heart? Stephenie Meyer's novel NEW MOON, sequel to TWILIGHT, is an exciting read, and one that I highly recommend.
serious As caveats, I would describe my beard density as significantly below average and I have fairly sensitive skin.  I have generally shaved with a double bladed razor in the past, but I have had problems with irritation of my neck.  This little shaver comes fairly close to a razor shave on the face and is, on a whole, better on the neck, with significantly less irritation.  I have taken to keeping one at work and another in my gym bag.
serious Let me say, I've owned several Sony digital cameras over the years. First a DSC-P50 circa 2001, then a couple of random ones I purchased new and wound up selling because they had poor picture quality. Then in 2005 I purchased a Sony DSC-W7 (7.2 mp) point-and-shoot. This is a good little camera but the PQ has always been a little hit and miss. I would say I got one or two good shots out of every 100.  Some problems with the W7 were autofocus that didn't focus properly (especially in indoor, low-light conditions), redeye was pervasive (even with the redeye reduction feature turned on), and shutter lag time. (One feature I liked about the W7 was the inclusion of an optical viewfinder, which it seems most of the manufacturers have now abandoned on these small digital cameras.)  Most of these problems seem to be addressed with the newest (2010) generation of Sony DSC point-and-shoots. I decided this was the time to replace the W7, and it came down to a choice between a DSC-W330 and DSC-W370. After taking some test photos in the store, and sending those photos to my personal computer at home for analysis, I decided to purchase the W370.  The W370 does not have an optical viewfinder, but it has everything else, and does everything right. The low-light, indoor shooting that the W7 could not handle is not an issue at all for the W370. Each indoor shot has been clear and well-focused, with exquisite background detail in shot after shot. In 10 test shots, only 1 came out bad, whereas with previous Sonys there might be 4 good shots and 6 bad.  The quality is light years ahead of the W330. I was attracted initially to the W330 because of its sleek look and small form factor (the W370 does not have this sex appeal), but the W370 blew the 330 out of the water in terms of photo quality, especially autofocus (always sharp) and redeye reduction (no redeye or hint of redeye at all in shot after shot).  In sum, I purchased the W370 and haven't looked back. This is an excellent little camera and everything a digital camera should be. Takes excellent photos whether indoors or out, natural light or artificial, bright conditions or low, etc. I highly recommend this product.
serious Baby Buttercreme is fantastic. In our house, we have four different hair textures. My husband has slightly coarse, wavy hair, my eldest son has loose soft curls, I have soft and tightly coily hair, and my baby has very tightly coiled and coarse hair. Baby Buttercreme is an effective moisturizer for all of us. Believe me, I have tried a ton of less expensive alternatives and none come close.
serious Lucy began as her father's experiment.  He raised her in the jungle while giving her a strong British education.  She was also raised by her mother who gave her an introduction to life as a bonobo.  The rest of the story is about what happens after her parents are killed and she is rescued and taken to the U.S. by Jenny.    First of all you must suspend reality to enjoy this book.  Most people seem willing to do that, with the popularity of vampire stories and Harry Potter.    Clearly I loved this book.  It is a good story, well written and just plain fun.  From the beginning I knew everything was not going to turn out okay so I prepared myself for tragedy but it came in a different way than I expected.  The way Jenny learns to love Lucy and becomes a mother to her is lovely to read.  Lucy's friendship with Amanda gives me hope that there are good people out there who really care about something other than themselves.  The same can be said for the Randalls who rescue the damsels in distress more than once.    I liked the sense of place wherever the story takes us.  I so enjoyed seeing the world through Lucy's eyes as she tries to become an American teenager.    This book should be popular with teens and adults alike.  It is light reading and goes fast.  I was sorry when it was over, as I wanted to know much more.  I hope it gets made into a movie.  I am so sick of vampire movies, I think this would be far more heartfelt.
serious Better than both "Seven" and "Natural Born Killers", director Matthew Bright's "Freeway" is a looseleaf modern view of Red Riding Hood where Reese Witherspoon plays Red traveling to Grandma's house.  Only she takes this trip after her prostitute mother and junkie stepdad are arrested, she escapes the cluthces of foster care, she says goodbye to her fiancee who is then murdered in a driveby shooting, she hitches a ride with a psycho who turns out to be a mass murderer, she kills a few people, ends up in lockup, escapes, finally makes it to Gradma's house, where some more bloody action takes place.  Oh yes, she has homosexual and heterosexual sex, spends a lot of time saying the "F" word, brutalizes most anyone that gets in her way, and otherwise creates mayhem for everybody. Sounds like your typical Reese Witherspoon role, eh? No, not by a long shot.  But one thing about her role -- she is fantastic, out of this world great. She is twice the actress in this role she was playing June Carter Cash, for which she won an Oscar as best actress. On the basis of these roles, Witherspoon must be considered one of the best actresses extant right now.  As the description here and on Amazon indicates, this movie presses the envelope of the "R" rating as far as possible without slipping over into NC-17. There is gory, bloody violence throughout this film, nudity and more "F" and "F"ing talk than you heard by Matt Damon when he played that low-class genius at Harvard. Someone told me they said "F" 147 times in that movie. Witherspoon herself must say it that many times here.  But none of this diminishes the astonishing electricity and action that swallows the viewer right from the opening scene, where junkie-hooker mom gets arrested and weirdo-junkie stepdad forces Reese to do the nasty while mom's out earning a living. There is an uncompromising level of reality in these characterization, too, although it's clearly an over the top psycho young Sutherland plays.  In an astonishing bit of casting, squeeky clean prom queen type Brooke Shields is cast as the uptight, upscale wife to lurid pervent and child molester Sutherland, whose character is even more disgusting than Witherspoon's. While everyone wants Sutherland rubbed out, Witherspoon manages to keep viewer sympathy because of for her terrible place in life even throughout her ongoing antisocial activities. Other players, incluidng Dan Hedaya as a cop with sympathies all over the place, contribute a lot to this film.  This is recommended for viewers unafraid to look inside the dark side of our culture where youngsters like the one Witherspoon plays actually exist. There is nothing pretty or orderly about this movie; much of it seems upside down. But it is unrelentingly exciting and is full of action in almost every scene, action you may never have seen in a film before. 
serious Got one of these from Fry's in a MB/CPU combo deal.  The processor is smoking fast with software that takes advantage of all 4 cores efficiently.  Examples would be Photoshop, Vegas, Winrar, Lightwave, Nero etc.  I got it specifically for crunching high definition video in Sony Vegas and editing high res graphics in Photoshop.  The processor really makes short work of previously long processing tasks.
serious As an avid user of smartphones, for years I've completely ignored a series of dull, uncreative phones running windows. While a variety of hardware form factors, some even technically superior to the competition, have come out, the software continued to look incredibly boring compared to the iPhone, Android, and even Blackberry. The main selling points consisted of "It runs windows and has a start button like you're used to on a computer" and "We have Office and sync with Outlook!". While these may have appealed to some business customers, the consistently shrinking market share of Windows phones demonstrated their lack of appeal to consumers as the recent smartphone boom hit.   With the HD2 this trend may finally be coming to an end. In conjunction with HTCs beautiful Sense interface, some aggressive hardware, and some genuine innovations, the HD2 is a Windows phone I can actually use and recommend. Let's start with the pros and follow up with a few drawbacks.   **Hardware**  -The 1ghz Snapdragon processor coupled with 448mb of ram is blazing fast. This is the fastest speed in a phone currently available. The HD2 loads everything quickly, and can run multiple apps at the same time. You can feel how fast the phone runs by playing with it for a few minutes. Gone are the sluggish Windows Phones of old, constantly running out of memory and crashing. The HD2 is fast and has top notch hardware and you can feel it.   -The screen is huge: 4.3 inches and stretching from corner to corner. The Resolution at 800x480 pixels means you'll see much more on that big screen than average. That means more room for icons and that sexy weather display on the main screen.   -The HD2 supports 3g on T-mobile, including the upcoming higher speed 3g. This means the fastest downloads and best call quality available. Note: the phone does NOT have ATTs 3g bands and the 3g will not work if you're using it unlocked on ATT.   -5mp camera with auto focus and 2 LEDs. 5mp is the highest we see on most phones, and the camera looks great. Having not 1 but 2 LEDs for flash seems a bit silly but works well. The phone even comes standard with a little flashlight app for a blindingly bright way to see in the dark.   -Included 3.5mm jack - this is becoming standard on most phones, and it's great to see it on the HD2. This allows you to use standard headphones without an adapter when playing music or listening to the built in FM Radio.  -Included wifi, bluetooth, and a hardware (real) GPS for turn by turn directions round out all the bells and whistles included in the phone.   -Battery life is similar to most smartphones. You will easily get a day's use without having to charge, but most likely you'll have to plug it in at night.   **Interface**  -HTC Sense is what really makes the phone shine here. This part of the software is done by HTC, not Windows, and runs on top of standard Windows Mobile 6.5 professional. HTC Sense expands on the previous TouchFLO 3d interface and enhances the way customers interact with the phone. Sense creates the beautiful Today screen, animations for messages, social networking features. It also lets you interact with the phone in unique ways, such as pinching to zoom. Some of these features are so close to the iPhone that Apple has recently filed lawsuits against HTC.   -The home screen is customizable, though not quite to the extent of Android phones. It lets you place a few apps on the screen, along with a beautiful standard weather app that detects your phone's location and shows the current time and weather in your city.   -Touch is a much better experience on this phone than previous windows mobile phones. The screen is capacitive, meaning it uses touch instead of pressure. No awkward stylus or pushing is needed for the touch to work. The phone responds quickly and smoothly to any motions.   -Basic phone features like placing a call or sending a text remain simple, with big buttons on the main screen to do so.   -Typing on the touchscreen is a breeze due to the size of the screen allowing for a bigger keyboard. As someone who has often stuck to phones with hardware keyboards due to inaccurate screen keyboards, I found typing on the HD2 much easier than previous touchscreen keyboards, although still not as easy as using a hardware keyboard. The HD2 also includes the new SWYPE interface, which lets you type by dragging your fingers through all the letters of a word instead of tapping each one. SWYPE was surprisingly accurate in typing the correct word and will even learn new words once you type them manually.   **Included Apps and Accessories**  -This phone is being marketed as a media phone, and includes several media apps to demonstrate that. MobiTV lets you watch what is essentially Cable TV on your phone free for 30 days and then ten dollars a month after that. Blockbuster lets you rent or buy movies for your phone. Barnes and Noble eReader lets you purchase ebooks.   -The phone comes with a huge 16gb MicroSD card out of the box. This is the biggest memory card available currently, and gives you plenty of room for pictures, videos, music, and apps. The best memory card pairs perfectly with the best processor and screen, and it's great that HTC did not hold back on this extra.   -Full videos of Transformers 1 and 2 are preloaded on the memory card. These videos look great and show off the beautiful screen. Note the movies do take about 4gb of space on the memory card.   -The phone comes with a gel skin in the box to protect the phone, which you would have to buy separately on most phones.   **Drawbacks**  -Price is the number one concern here. The phone is priced higher than competing smartphones. This price seems justified, however, due to the cutting edge hardware in the HD2. It also comes with some nice accessories you'd have to buy separately from other phones. Upgrade and new customer deals will certainly lower the cost for those buying from T-mobile.   -The app store is another drawback. The good news is that the phone has one, the bad news is it's the smallest of ANY smartphone operating system. As of this review the Windows Marketplace carried less than 1,000 applications, compared to Android at 20,000 apps and iPhone at a staggering 150,000 apps. Even Blackberry, Palm, and Nokia carry more apps than Windows. You are also going to find significantly more paid than free applications for Windows Mobile apps. The Marketplace is simply far behind that of competing phones, which for a heavy app user will diminish the enjoyment of the HD2 by quite a bit.   -Windows Mobile 7 upgradeability is still up in the air, but it currently looks like this phone will NOT be getting an upgrade when the new OS is released. The phone does not support some key hardware feature (front buttons) that WM7 requires, and therefore it is unlikely to be upgraded. The upcoming OS promises to be very exciting, and the fact that this beautiful phone will probably not receive the upgrade is disappointing.   Overall this phone is fast, pretty, and offers top of the line features. The phone feels solid (and huge) in your hand, while the software is fast, works well and is fun to use. If the HD2 is any indicator, Windows Mobile may become a legitimate competitor in the smartphone market again. The phone seems to be selling very well, with T-mobile selling out almost everywhere the day the HD2 was released.  I'd recommend this phone as a viable alternative to Android and the iPhone.
serious I did not think I needed yet another remote control because I thought the six-axis had everything it needed for movie playing on the PS3 and, yet, I bought one. There were 2 initial reasons:  - my wife was missing a 'magic wand' shaped remote for playing movies - Amazon had it at a great price in one of them lightning deals  I ended up using it myself and, in fact, using it for more than just movie playing - see below.  But, let's do a quick inventory of features:  = It's blue-tooth enabled and, therefore, it's not taking any ports on your PS3. This is probably important for anyone who has a "2-USB ports console". = It's wand-shaped, allowing the non-gamers to control their movie-watching activities while holding a familiar-shaped device in their hand. = It maps ALL the six-axis buttons and performs everything a six-axis would do, except for the joystick features of R3 and L3 (but you do have the push-down or 'click' abilities for them). = 2 AA battery powered (still with the original Sony batteries after 4 months of use) = Includes additional buttons that the movie-only users would expect on a remote such as:  + a number pad  + eject  + red, green, blue, yellow buttons  + play, stop, pause  + slow(step), scan(left/right), prev/next  + display, top menu, pop up menu, return  + subtitles, angle, audio   What is interesting about this remote is that you can use it for much more than movie-playing. Given that it has all the six-axis buttons, guess what? You can use it, and I do use it to:  - surf the web - play music - shop at the PSN store - play certain games such as Sudoku - turn the PS3 on/off when your six-axis controllers are in the charger and I am playing GT5 that is using a racing wheel  And, yes, you CAN turn the PS3 on and off with this remote. Turning it on is easy - you simply press the PlayStation button and the PS3 turns itself on. To turn it off, you either go as far to the left on the X-bar and all the way up and press Enter (the turn-off PlayStation icon will be highlighted) or you simply hold the PlayStation button pressed for a few seconds and then select 'yes' and press the X button a couple of times.  Overall: I am happy with this peripheral. Yes, it's one more remote control but it's a pretty good one, for the reasons I stated above.  _______________________________  Notes - Aug 29, 2009, after 16 months of use  I find that I'm using the remote more and more, not only for playing movies but for navigating the XMB and at the PSN Store, also when playing music or slideshows. Due to its very convenient arrows wheel with an 'enter' button in the middle, navigating the PS3 and doing just about anything other than playing games is a lot easier than using the PS3 game controller. Unlike the controller which normally requires two hands to hold, this is basically a one-hand operation where you hold the remote in one hand and operate the wheel with your thumb. And because it's Bluetooth, not IR (Infrared), you don't even need to point it at the PS3.  And, one word on battery life. After about 15-16 months of operation, this is probably the third set of batteries so I'd estimate battery life to be about 4-6 months. Not too bad.
serious When I dislike a book, I often don't dwell on it, because what's the point, right? But my reaction to this book went BEYOND dislike, and I felt I had to vent about it a little bit to get it out of my system.   This book was horrible. Absolutely horrible. I bought it because it was featured in a magazine I read, and I'd heard good things about it, so I decided to give it a try...as a die-hard fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and fantasy literature in general, I thought it was right up my alley. I was wrong.  First of all, I was *disgusted* by the main characters. I actually think one can dislike a character and still like the book/writing, but in this case, the main characters were pathetic and boring. The female lead (Bella Swan. Really. Bella Swan. Why not just call her Pretty McPerfect and have done with it?) is completely vapid. She has no goals, no dreams, no ambition, no personality aside from being miserable and obsessed with her boyfriend. Now, ok, it's romance. Fine. But romance can be accomplished...and often in a better way...if the participants have strong, defining character traits. It heightens the tension and makes the results much more satisfying. Bella had no defining character traits. I don't even remember what she was supposed to look like. She was selfish and misanthropic for absolutely no reason, and she acted like a spoiled martyr for far too many pages. It's really quite depressing that this book is being touted for teenage girls, because the main character is a HORRIBLE role model in every sense of the word. Why not portray her as having goals? Dreams? Ambitions? It would serve to heighten the conflict and make the book better in the long run.  But anyway. The love interest, superhot vampire Edward, is downright scary. And not in like...the good way. He stalks her. He makes decisions for her. He doesn't listen to her views or opinions (not that she has any, really). He encourages her to lie. He puts her in danger...no matter how many times he whines about the emotional toll it puts on him, he still doesn't stop putting her in danger. He is cruel and arrogant. AND SHE ACCEPTS THIS! He keeps telling her how she needs him to look after her, how she would die or something if it wasn't for him. AND SHE IS NOT OFFENDED/ANNOYED BY THIS. Seriously! Even the most ambivalent feminist should find this insulting and derogatory!   There's absolutely no chemistry between the leads. She loves him because he is beautiful. He loves her because he wants to eat her and she smells good. Really. He tells her she is like his heroin. How is that in anyway healthy? She is willing to die for someone she barely knows, someone who plays mind games with her, who dominates her completely. She admits to being completely obsessed with him. And there are no consequences for this! She has no doubts about her emotions toward him!  Ugh. I could go on, but I won't. I just want to say that this is probably the worst book I have ever read, and I'm not too far removed from the teen audience this book is geared to. I see no redeeming features at ALL, except perhaps the character Jacob, who seems like the only person in this entire book that has any interesting and healthy character traits. But now that I've gotten this out of my system, I do feel better.   In short...please don't read this book. Please.
serious Back home in Scotland I ate haggis at least twice a week and it's been a major craving for the 8 months I've lived in the US. This isn't that similar to tinned haggis in Scotland; mainly the texture of tinned haggis back home is finer and drier than this...but it is fairly close to the 'real' haggis in a skin and is spiced just perfectly. I think preparation counts for a lot with this haggis and I dry fry it in a pan whilst stirring it until it just starts to brown as I think that improves the texture. All in all it's great with a baked potato or just for fellow Scots missing a taste of home. If you haven't tried haggis then this is a great example of how good it is...and it really is like nothing else!
serious This is a sham. They dont even have them available. They need to correct their postings.  So don't bother order one, because in bout a day you will get an email saying sorry but we dont have it.  Not worth the time or effort.
serious The product is exactly as depicted. I search amazon for currently available iPad cases and I think this is the best one available.  The leather foods good, the iPad fits snug in the case and the prop up slots for viewing the device at various angles works great. Used this during a long flight and am very happy with my purchase.
serious I have never written a review before but I have to say that this product is one of the best things that I've ever bought. I am a terrible typer and this allows me to write reports about twice as fast and without all the headache of correction. I almost didn't buy this product because of all of the terrible reviews on Amazon.com.  It seems that if you are using Vista, or are an English as a 2nd language student, or have a very old computer then you might have problems using Dragon. I have 2 GB of RAM on 2005 HP Pavilion laptop running XP  I understand that people are not happy with tech support but I have yet to use it. Also when loading the software I also faced a C++ error message that was a headache but I was able to fix it with a simple Google search.  Last year I had my Mac stolen, but now I couldn't be happier because now I can use the software on my new XP, that I couldn't have used if I still had a Mac.  I'm using the software to type this review and I would say that it has made perhaps 2 errors, but that is understandable given that sometimes I speak quickly and there is some ambiguity in what I'm writing.  I can honestly say that the software has changed my life. I love my job now!
serious After thoroughly enjoying Tom Goes to the Major, and the first season of TAEASGJ, I was overjoyed when they got a contract for more seasons. Then I tuned in...  Somehow, the novelty wore off, and the cleverness disappeared. Was it just filler? Were they burnt out and wanting out of their contract? Instead of getting better a lot of bits were so poor in comparison. While watching this season I felt embarrassed for the comedians I normally enjoy.   Looking into the dead eyes of the main stars, it seems like they sold their soul for a longer contract. And when they lost that they also lost their ability to be funny and clever.
serious Wish I can get my weekend back. It builds up your interest initially and then drags and to top it all a worst ending. No idea what was author trying to say, as characters were not fully developed and a bad bad bad ending. Thank God I just bought one book of Tana French.
serious My daughter slept better on this mattress the very first time that we put her down on it (and that's saying something, since she didn't want to sleep anywhere else but between us on our king size bed). It's been about 11 months since then, and she sleeps fabulously on this mattress. I can't recommend it highly enough.   I appreciate that it's organic - and that there are no harmful chemicals - and that it is still fire-resistant.   I think the coil system is far more comfortable than the foam (which she had before) - and it still provides extremely firm support.   It's pricey, yes, but the return to civilized life (a.k.a. when she started sleeping through the night) was worth just about any price.   I'm now about to buy a second one for my next baby!
serious I think this is definitely my favorite book that I've read so far by Jennifer Weiner.  As much as there were sad things happening, it was uplifting at the same time.  I really liked all of the characters.  They completely seemed real to me.  I kept thinking of Sylvie, the mom, and relating her to my mom.  And how my mom is always there backing up my dad and how if my dad was unfaithful I could see the next series of events unfolding the same way they did in the book.  I could also relate to a little bit of something in each of the sisters.  They were both so different and started off so far apart emotionally but grew towards each other.  I thought the plot seemed very realistic.  And I loved the little pop culture/current events tidbits that were in the story.  Some are so recent that I think its incredible that they're in the book.  And I think that some women might not like the ending with Sylvie, but I did.  Without giving away what happens, I think I would have made the same choice that she did.  A great summer read! 
serious My boyfriend thought it would be funny, so he picked one up at Walgreens and gave it to me.   It started out as a joke, but guess what? I actually ended up liking this thing - a lot! I've had it for almost a year and I use it all the time (when the weather is chilly). The material is thin, and it looks cheap. I was not impressed with it when I first saw it, but after using it I discovered that even though it is thin, it's still really warm. I have washed it many times and it is still in great condition. It's soft and my dog really likes snuggling with me when I use it.   The other day we went to Petsmart and discovered the dog Snuggie. Of course my boyfriend had to get it. It was supposed to be another joke. Me and my dog with matching Snuggies! I honestly did not expect my dog to wear it, but he really loves it too. He won't let me take it off. The box is really funny. There is a picture of a dog relaxing on the couch with his remote control and another picture of a couple of dogs playing backgammon. (I'm easily ammused, I suppose)  In summary, it started out as a joke. The Snuggie has provided me with lots of laughs. But more importantly, I love my Snuggie because it does what it says it will do - it keeps me warm and comfortable, and yet, my hands are free!   
serious I purchased this product for my 20 month old son to use on a 800 mile car trip. It was very helpful for giving him small snacks like cereal, and crackers while on the road. Much easier than handing him one piece at a time! The tray wiped clean very easily. There were some crumbs in the corners, but we just shook them out into the trash. It was also good for small toys and books. I like that it is made out of a soft, but durable material, which makes it safe in case of a car accident. The material feels like the padded shoulder straps of a backpack. It is lightweight, and my son didn't seem to mind it. He even fell asleep with the tray in place. This tray will go with us on every car trip in the future!
serious Be aware that this is not out until next summer - June 24. Had it on order since Sept for an Xmas present and am disappointed no release date was listed or given by Amazon.  Can't wait!!! Great season - better than 1, even!!
serious This is an awsome T-shirt, my son loves it!!  He loves dragons, drawing them, reading about them etc.  So when we saw this dragon shirt we had to get it.  This seller is a very good seller. Shipping was only 3 working days with the weekend in between them.  It came fast!  Will buy from this seller again.
serious The Denon AKDL1 cables increase polarized hyperbaric ethernet throughput to over 70 petabytes/second. This cable is the first in a series of nano-molecular para-polarized transparent aluminum cabling, soon to be standard in all Denon audiophile equipment.  Since carefully installing the Denon cables using the provided surgical gloves, my system has stablized in Hilbert space. Apparently the Denon AKDL1 performs polarized nanoscale quantum tunneling by using a custom transparent aluminum cable matrix to push parameterized vorgon particles through a dark fibre phase variant Heisenberg compensator. How they accomplish this for only $500, I don't know.  
serious works great. I travel in my car & have to sit & work on my computer often during lunch--its a lifesaver.
serious For starters Amazon delivers on their promise of a 3-day delivery. This is a company you can count on.   The Zx1 is right on target. Right out of the box it does exactly what you would expect from a small pocket video camera - decent quality and simple operation. Even indoors the quality was acceptable - which is more than you can say about most cameras in this class.  This is clearly a second-generation pocket video camera - with improved controls and support for large capacity SD cards. The AA batteries are just what you need to make sure you will never run out. I was surprised to see that a charger was included.  My big concern about buying a Flash Drive HD camera was the issue of file format. This is a thorny issue with all HD video cameras. I could care lass about HD - I just wanted decent quality and the ability to edit video.   The plan is simple - archive the 'HD' content and keep it for future editing when software and hardware are readily available. And meanwhile convert the files to AVI or another usable DVD formtat for immediate use.  The supplied ArcSoft program does primitive conversion of the 720p format to 640 DVD format - but in Quicktime - which Windows Media player version 9 still refuses to recognize in Windows XP ( I hate Vista)  There are many third party programs which do a better job of conversion - the one I use is AVS Video Converter 6. It took the raw MOV file from the SD card and converted it to AVI format with the 720 lines preserved and good sound quality. As with all such conversions it is slow but the quality is excellent. This is not a trivial conversion. Of course AVS will convert it to any of a dozen other formats - some with smaller file size - but none with higher quality.  Since this camera is so new, the Kodak web site has very limited documentation for the Zx1. They avoid entirely the issue of file formats and that is because it is a thorny issue. Along these lines I should mention that without loading any software, you can slip the SD card in your computer slot and you will get a MOV file. It comes up as a Quicktime file. My version of Quicktime played the movie O.K but there was no sound. I'm sure an update is available - but it may not be free. Of course my Quicktime player did play the MOV file after it was converted by ArcSoft.   Hey for $150 - this is a great buy and it seems to be durable also.     
serious I bought this chandelier a few months ago for $83.99.  What a great value!  A note of caution: the instructions were amateurish - I would have appreciated more details since this was my first time installing a chandelier.  But a quick search online and I was able to find better instructions.  It ended up taking a couple of hours to assemble and install but it was well worth the time.  It looks fantastic in my dining room and the price is hard to beat.
serious I bought this hard disk primarily for use with Apple Time Machine from two Mac laptops - a Macbook and a Macbook Pro. The drive comes formatted for Windows but a reformat only took a few seconds. Usable space on the drive is 931.5GB -  I have the drive partitioned, 600GB for Time Machine and 330GB for general usage.  The drive is very smart, with a textured top and glossy sides and has rubber feet. Both connectors (power and usb) are at the back, next to a white activity light, so there's nothing flashing at the front. The power lead is fairly compact (compared to my Lacie FA Porsche drive), with the transformer built in to the plug rather than halfway along the lead. Even the USB cable is well designed, with moulded easy-grip ends.  The drive is almost completely silent and runs very cool despite having no fan. I've probably moved about 1TB on and off it over the last 24 hours and it's never even been warm. Transfer speeds seem to be around 1GB/minute for both large files (a 200GB SuperDuper sparseimage) and many small files (my 50GB iTunes library), which is about standard for a USB hard disk as far as other reviews say. This equates to about 130Mb/s - USB is apparently capable of 480Mb/s, but I've never seen those speeds.  The drive has a two year warranty in the UK/Europe, which I think is the same as other drives in the WD range (although the My Book Elite has 3 years).  All in, for a budget external drive this is a great buy with solid build and performance to match any decent USB drive.
serious I love my helmet. It looks awesome and feels solid. I like that it has a padded protection that covers the ears and back of the neck that can be taken off by unzipping. There's also a detachable visor that snaps on the front. I use it for when I ride my moped and if I tilt my head down, it cuts the wind so it's not blowing as much in my eyes and face. It's very comfortable and not too heavy. It fits perfectly in the storage compartment under my moped seat, which is great if you don't want it to get stolen or have to carry it wherever you're going.
serious This movie is great, and full of action.  I was never a fan of wrestling and knew very little about the Rock.  I rented this movie last night for my boyfriend and I to watch. Since I was strictly informed not to get any chick-flicks, I figured this was the best choice.  It is based on a true story about a guy named Beauford Pusser (gross name) who after comming home from the millitary notices a great deal of change in his home town. The mill he and his father once worked at is now closed and the main source of income for this small town is the casino/strip club owned by his former friend.  Things turn ugly whe Chris Vaughn (The Rock) notice the casino is cheating their customers.  He tries to go to the police and they are just as crooked as the casino, so the Rock takes matters into his own hands.  Great movie choice for ladies wanting to please their boyfriend with a non-chickflick. But don't worry ladies even if you don't like the story line, you will still enjoy it, because the Rock is very nice to look at!! Enjoy.
serious We bought and applied this product when my son started teething.  It is VERY important to first thoroughly clean the surface where you plan on applying the strip with alcohol.  If there is any oily residue, the adhesive will not stay put.  Our son is now four, and our one-year-old daughter has inherited this crib.  The original rail protector is still in place and not so much as a corner has started to lift.
serious After having devoured The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)  I was very much looking forward to The Girl Who Played With Fire. But somehow the story did not captivate me as much as the first Lisbeth Salander / Mikael Blomkvist book. And here are my main points of criticism:  1. There is no direct interaction between Lisbeth and Mikael in this story. They are connected by the events, yes, but the unique relationship that had begun to develop between them in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was not continued here, and for me this was a key element and one of the main reasons I was so fascinated with the characters. With every page I turned (and there are many!), I was hoping to see them come together again, alas it only happened at the very end of the book and even then there was no communication between the two.  2. The storyline - to me - was much less believable than in the first book. There are a few (for lack of a better word) improbabilities here that almost ruined it for me. Especially the scene towards the end, where Lisbeth is confronted with her brother and her father and their unspeakable act against her (I don't want to give anything away, so no details but you will know what I mean when you get to it). The coherence I so admired in the first book was just not that well executed in The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage) .  3. The end came extremely abruptly. I actually went online after finishing it to make sure that I hadn't somehow received an issue with some of the pages missing. I just couldn't believe that this book with several hundred pages and tons of details given on those would simply end like this. But it did and left me shaking my head a bit.  In summary, this is not a bad thriller but it did not reach the masterful craftsmanship and effortlessness that made the first book an absolute standout in the ocean of thrillers on the market.  
serious I think 'Brown Sugar' is a film that had a lot of potential with all the characterizations in it but failed to deliver as a blockbuster. For example, the movie tries (way too hard) to take you "back in the day" with the birth of Hip Hop. That is fine but for the one millionth and one time: How many times will Sanaa or Taye Diggs say 'Hip Hop'? We get the point. The soundtrack could have been more documentary with Hip Hop/ Neo-Soul music from the 1980s to 2000s.   Another the thing that I could not stand is the illecit love affair between Sanaa (Sydney) & Taye Diggs (Dre) characters, after Dre got MARRIED. It would have been nice to see them turn their friendship into a more than plutonic level, even after he proposed to Nicole Ari Parker's character. Afterall, she wasn't really in love with him in the first place, and he had made a rush of judgement. But sadly, he gets married and then Taye Diggs falls in love with his best friend. What about his wife?  Finally, it would have been nice to see the Hip Hop Industry's B-Side present challenges that challenged their friendship. It was like a smooth ride love story with a twist of adultery, and the ending was too obvious. With a good romance, who cares about an obvious ending but at least give me some plots and intrigue and a reason to watch the film several more times. The ending made me shake my head! And with all the potential, this film did not deliver mainly because of adulterous themes and an annoying focus on 'Hip Hop'.
serious This is a great tool.  Simple to use, has two sides, one fine, and the other larger teeth.  Its metal and a bright color so not easy to lose or break.  It gives my watercolor paper the look of deckled edges on all four sides which works for me in framing my work and giving it that professional look.
serious I like how the zinc oxide gives the balm a hint on white. This helped me make sure lips were completely covered with protection.
serious Just got my receiver today, plugged everything and turned it on. At first, I was bit confused about setting it up and the remote controll, but after reading a bit from the manual I managed to set things up. After this I made a short sound check to see that everything worked and it did. Then I downloaded the update from Yamahas site and tried updating the receiver with PS3 Slim. Well for my suprice, receiver was already up to date. So now I wanted to test HD sounds and put Rambo IV in, and just wow, sound is great! Even I dont have the best speakers in the world, it still sounded a lot better than anything what I played before with my non-HD Sony receiver. After I had watched the movie I put radio on and just left it there. It has now been on for around 8 hours on row and every now and then when good song comes I turn volume up, but still its really hard to sence any heat over the receiver. Ok, it has only been in use for a day but so far I have really nothing to complain. Everything is connected with HDMI so I didn't need the analog upconversing. Even 7.1 system seems to work ok, but I don't have really anything to test it with, all blue-ray's only have 5.1 I was thinking of getting some 7.1 test trak later but so far so good. For me the thing that last 2 speakers need to be active ones (to get 6.1 or 7.1) wasn't an issue since I took those from my bedroom tv. Maybe going to put those back to bedroom atleast for a while when I can get something that has 7.1 sounds.
serious I couldn't be happier with this purchase. I've always been fairly inactive and now that I'm in my mid-40s, it's been starting to cause an overall lack of stamina and back pain and exhaustion from walking short distances (and I'm not even overweight). But after just 2 weeks of Wii Fit Plus (usually 30 -45 minutes per day), I'm really noticing a difference. I'm thrilled!  You can work up a sweat without even noticing because you're having so much fun. The Island Cycling is my favorite (love the Island View Course). It definitely gets your blood pumping. Some of my other favorites include Rhythm Kung Fu, Advanced Step, Hula Hoop, Obstacle Course, Rhythm Parade, Bull's Eye, Jogging and Boxing. There are so many choices that it's hard to imagine anyone not finding something that's fun for them or that suits their needs and goals (unless they're already in great shape).  Some of the activities can be a bit challenging to get the hang of (and it seems that different people have trouble with different things). I'm disastrous at skateboarding, but I'm a "calorie torcher" at obstacle course. My boyfriend's 12-year-old son got quickly frustrated with the obstacle course, but I bet he'd be a natural at skateboarding. You just have to find what works for you. Fortunately there are plenty of choices!  Another fun feature is that you feel like you're working out with your friends and family. As your family members add themselves to the program (and you can also add your pets), they are featured throughout the game. Your regular Wii friends are featured too, but not as prominently. They cheer you on at the finish line, demonstrate the moves, toss you your hula hoops, march in your band, etc., and your pet can run along side you as you cycle. It can be an added little boost to your workout. Wii Fit Plus also keeps track of your best times/scores, so it's fun to be able to challenge your previous records. It always feel great when you beat your previous best.  The yoga is good if you like a more calm, relaxed type of workout. Personally I have a hard time staying away from the more active games, but I'm glad it's there when I want to work on strength. 
serious I recieved this filter with my Keurig B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System  for Christmas this year, so I cannot review its durability.  I have some worries based on the previous reviews, but I'll hope for the best.  As far as the coffee this makes, it is great.  Of course, it greatly depends on the coffee you use.  The coffee I find myself using most in the filter is Peet's Major Dickason's Blend, but I've tried many others and they are all superb.  It is hard to believe, but this produces a cup of coffee just as good as a K-Cup.  It is nice to be able to fill it to the very top to get a nice strong cup, as well as use coffees not available in K Cups.  It also saves a lot of money.  I try to use this more than K Cups and that will keep the expense of K Cups low enough for me.  Note: Many reviews specify a type of grind, but I find that a medium grind that you would find in a bag of pre-ground works great.  Also, filling it to the top leaving a little room works best for me.  If this lasts a reasonable amount of time, it is certainly worth the price to replace it.  UPDATE: I have already reviewed this product.  I got it this Christmas with a Keurig B40.  I got a "good" my k cup.  I was worried by the bad reviews about it breaking.  Clearly, some of these are made faulty.  I found this when i bought a second so I wouldn't have to wash the first over and over.  I got a "bad" one.  These filters are great, unless you get a bad one.  Before you use your new filter, make sure that the top EASILY tightens onto the filter.  If it does, you have a good one.  If it is difficult, return it go get another.  If your are buying in store, check first.  If you own a Keurig, you need one of these, but make sure you get the right one!  (UPDATE: 6 months later; the filter still works great, but I have found that only coarsely ground coffee will work without it getting clogged.  If you are using medium/fine ground coffee and it gets clogged, leaving you with little coffee, use coarsely ground.  It took me a while to figure this out.  Now it works every time.
serious It seems the main reason Dr. Peter Lillback calls George Washington a Christian,and not a Deist is because he believed in Divine Providence,or the belief that God is active in peoples lives. When we think of Divine Providence we think of the word Theism, and all the Abrahamic faiths that claim God personally spoke to key individuals called Prophets in the form of personal revelations.  Understandably as words do change (proving that the written word is not a good vehicle for the "word of God") from their original meaning, Mr.Lillback confuses the word Deist with the word Atheist (non-Theist) which really is the opposite of Theist.    In todays world the word Atheist for the most part implies that there is no God.  The word Atheist has changed from its original meaning,but we know that whenever you add an "a" in front of a word it means the opposite,so its the Atheist that believes in a inactive God,and not a Deist.  The word Deist is derived from the word Deism that is derived from the word Deity which is simply the Latin word for God. A Deist is just someone who believes that God is,and the word Deism just implies a path of understanding.   George Washington IMO was a Deist who was a Theist who followed the path called Deism.  He believed in God,he thought that God was active in his life,and he knew to look towards the Creation (the product that comes from God) to gain true insight.  Since Mr. Lillback uses Thomas Paine for an example of a Deist we should at least take Thomas Paine's definition on who,or what a Deist is,and what a true Deist believe.    "Every person, of whatever religious denomination he may be, is a DEIST in the first article of his Creed. Deism, from the Latin word Deus, God, is the belief of a God, and this belief is the first article of every man's creed.  It is on this article, universally consented to by all mankind, that the Deist builds his church, and here he rests. Whenever we step aside from this article, by mixing it with articles of human invention, we wander into a labyrinth of uncertainty and fable, and become exposed to every kind of imposition by pretenders to revelation"  Thomas Paine thought that anyone who believes in God was a Deist (including all Christians) in the first article of his creed, which is the belief in a God.   Mr. Lillback states in his book that Thomas Paine was a "hard Deist".  "Hard Deist", apparently a new title that Mr. Lillback says he made up to describe a Deist that doesn't believe in Divine Providence,or again the belief in the God that went away,and no longer intervenes in mans affairs. Again a "Hard Deist" if we must use the phrase describes what an Atheist would think,and not what a pure Deist would think.  Dr. Peter Lillback either never read Thomas Paines works,or he's out right lying about Thomas Paines character in matters of God. All self professed Deists in our founding fathers day believed in Divine Providence even Thomas Paine. So "Hard Deist",or even Atheist would not apply to Mr. Paine because Thomas Paine was a Deist (he believed in God) who was a Theist (he believed that God was active in his life) who followed the path called Deism.  In Mr. Lillbacks book he quotes Thomas Paine several times,but he takes his words out of context to make his point clear about who,or what a Deist is,and what a true,or pure Deist really believes about our Maker.  Before I quote some key phrases from Thomas Paine that clearly prove that he, like George Washington believed in "Divine Providence" I ask the reader to examine   "A Discourse At The Society Of Theophilanthropists"  This was a Theistic church that Thomas Paine was a key founder. Proving that Mr. Paine believed in an active God right up till the end of his life.  Thomas Paine called God "the Almighty lecturer".  God had something to say to Thomas Paine,and luckily for us he wrote most of it down in all his Theological writings.   "The Almighty Lecturer, by displaying the principles of science in the  structure of the universe, has invited man to study and imitation. It is as if He said to the  inhabitants of this globe, that we call ours, 'I have made an earth for man to dwell upon,  and I have rendered the starry heavens visible, to teach him science and the arts. He  can now provide for his own comfort, and learn from my munificence to all, to be kind to  each other.' "   "The world has been amused with the term revealed religion, and the generality of priests apply this term to the books called the Old and New Testament. The Mahometans apply the same term to the Koran. There is no man that believes in revealed religion stronger than I do; but it is not the reveries of the Old and New Testament, nor the Koran, that I dignify with that sacred title. That which is revelation to me, exists in something which no human mind can invent, no human hand can counterfeit or alter. The Word of God is the Creation we behold; and this Word of God revealeth to man all that is necessary for man to know of his Creator."  Mr. Lillback is using his own definition of what a Deist is to prove that George Washington wasn't a Deist,and his definition is wrong. Instead of making up your own definition of these words (Deist,or Deism) to prove your point why not get the correct definition from those who actually claim to be true,or pure Deists?  Most (not all) of todays self professed Deists of today like days of old will tell you that they believe in a active God.   Did George Washington believe that our Creator overshadowed a young virgin girl who was engaged to be married to save us from the sins of the world,and all the mythologies that would also need to be believed as fact to prove this absurdity?    George Washington was enlightened enough to know mythologies from reality.  Lets not taint this great mans legacy by saying he believed the Bible as an absolute literal truth just because you do Mr. Lillback.  This book IMO in no way proves George Washington was a true Christian.  Like they did with the man called Jesus years after his death making him into something he was not Dr. Peter Lillback does this with our great American hero George Washington. Turning,or perverting true 'history" into his story,and twisting reality in the process.  People who look for truth will know the difference.  Mr.Lillback, we're all Deists who believe that God is.  Where we differ is our path of understanding. If you want to learn all about the faiths of our ancestors then the Bible,Koran,and the like are a great place to gain insight, however if you want to learn about God then you must look towards the Creation,or all the products that come from God. I think George Washington knew this truth as he was surrounded by other enlightened "pure" Deists.  Mr. Washington knew that books prove that man is real,and the Creation proves that God is real.   This book will look great next to the other fat book in the evangelical library.  Remember just because a book is thick,and fat doesn't make it fact.
serious Did not work with my Onkyo receiver; had to return the item.  On the up side: the return process with Amazon was wonderful.  I provided the necessary documentation and followed the steps outlined on Amazon.com re: how to return an item, and the return went VERY smooth.
serious I just finished reading BIAS and I HIGHLY recommend it for people of all political persuasions.  A couple things to note: 1. It's a very engaging read -- well written and entertaining on top of infomative.   2. It's much more SUBSTANTIAL than I expected.  I thought it would just be an anti-liberal gossip session but it had a LOT of MEAT in it that I think would be interesting to any AMERICAN, not just a conservative one. 3. I've always sensed a liberal bias in the media, but thought that was just "spin" ...reporting the PART of the news that fit their agenda.  I was sincerely shocked to learn of instances where they have FLAT OUT LIED to us. Great Book!
serious People are finally realizing what I have known for years from watching "Knight Rider." David Hasselhoff can sing! Since the days of "Knight Rider," I thought David should record an album. It wasn't until the 1990's, during a publicized Pay Per View event that I realized Hasselhoff was doing just that. He had a second career as a singer, over seas! If you can find it, "Looking for Freedom," is an electerically charged album that is a must have for any David Hasselhoff fan. This album is not his best but it is definately above average.  Some of my favorite tracks on the album are: Looking for Freedom Flying on the Wings of Tenderness Lonley is the Night Sheltered Heart  song of the Night Being that Hasselhoff made his mark as a singer over seas. Most of his music is marked as an import and can be hard to find. If you are looking for more music David Hasselhoff Amazon.com is the place to come. without their help I would not have found this album.
serious Does exactly what it should do, fits the iphone snugly and definitely improves battery life DRAMATICALLY.  To answer some of the common questions: 1. The on/off switch turns the battery back on or off - not sure why you'd want to turn it off, but if you do, the iphone will run on its own battery.  When on, the iphone will first drain the pack, then its own battery. 2. Charging - it charges via standard micro USB, and yes, you charge the phone just by connecting the case (no need to charge separately).  The one time you may want to separate them is if the pack is dead and you iphone is close to dead, since the pack needs to get a bit of a charge before it will charge the iphone...  Which brings me to how the thing ACTUALLY works: yes, it's a battery, however your iphone will simply treat it as though it is plugged into a wall outlet/usb cable: you'll see the plugged in symbol, and charging symbol on the iphone screen.  Once the battery pack dies, that turns off.  It's pretty ingenious actually.  On the back of the device are 3 LED lights showing if it's fully charged: when all 3 are lit, it's full...when 1 is lit, its 1/3 etc.  Any way you slice it, this is a TREMENDOUS improvement over the battery life of my rapidly failing 3G battery.  Pros: Extends battery life dramatically, fits securely around iphone 3G, charges with standard micro USB cable Cons: Adds a substantial amount of weight to the device, takes a decent amount of time to get a good charge, will not fit into any iphone docks (ipod dock connector does not stock out of case) -  this includes ANYTHING you connect to in the past (car kits too) - so if you still want to use those, you will need to remove the bottom of the case.  While it feels fairly sturdy, I'm not sure how much of that kind of abuse it can take.
serious Simple Plan's second original CD, "Still Not Getting Any . . . " gives its legion of fans no letdown after the long wait for the second CD.  If anything, it is an improvement on the first.    Fans at their shows have already been introduced to "Welcome to My Life" and "Shut Up!", both good, catchy songs just packed with the adolescent angst that is SP's trademark.  "Shut Up!" in particular, shows the band's knack for combining downbeat lyrics with upbeat tunes, in a song which I interpret as a teenager's thoughts while being lectured by his parents.    Something's changed a bit from the first CD, and that's the band's perspective.  Many of the songs on "No Pads, No Helmets, . . . Just Balls" had the perspective of a teen complaining about a poor relationship with a parent.  There's still a bit of that in songs like "Me Against The World" and "Shut Up!", but this time, more songs talk about a romantic relationship gone bad (for example, "Perfect World", "Everytime" and "Thank You"), and the perspective is more young adult than teenager--"Everytime" talks about the partner waking the singer at 3 a.m. and driving to dawn--not likely if still living at home.  The band's characters are maturing, as is their music.    Other notable songs include "Crazy", a throwback to Reset's (the predecessor band to Simple Plan) socially-conscious songs, and "Jump", plainly intended as a concert song but very strong in its own right.    Perhaps the strongest song on the CD is "Untitled", a downbeat song with downbeat music, the dying thought of someone who doesn't know why he's dying, and despite the people around him, is dying utterly alone.  The sadness which runs through many of the band's works is here in full strength.  Softer than usual and using a piano (shades of "Meet You There" on the first CD), even if never released as a single, it may well be the band's best song to date.    While lead singer Pierre Bouvier did almost all the singing on the first CD, much more is heard from backup singers Sebastien Lefebvre and David Derosiers do a lot more of the singing here, and they are well worth listening to.    Extras on the DVD or flip side (depending on edition) include the video for "Welcome to My Life" and the program (shown, I believe, on MTV) about its making.  Highly, highly recommended. 
serious These gloves have turned out to be some of the best ones I've had in a while!  I'm a hot natured guy, so these work perfect on the warmer weather rides.  The air vents are perfectly placed to keep air flowing through the glove and to keep you from sweating too much against the leather.  On colder rides, they may not keep you warm enough if you're a cold natured person, but for me they're perfect!  I highly recommend these to anyone who wants to stay a little cooler during those long rides!
serious I have used many irons in my life but have not liked any as well as I like this iron. It has a removable water reserve which makes emptying it very easy. I ordered this iron, the price was right and it arrived at my home very speedily. I would highly recommend this iron.
serious THIS THING IS AWESOME.  I AM NEVER SHAVING AGAIN. I just used it for the first time and have decided that I will never use a razor again.  I am a guy who never likes to shave, I maintain the "few days of stubble" look throughout the week, and dread the day when I have to go through the hassle of lathering up & shaving.  But this thing is so easy to use and it just cuts you down to whatever stubble-level you want in like 2 minutes!!!! PLUS it's got this vacuum-device on it that sucks up the stray hairs into a special chamber, which you then pull out and empty when you're done trimming.   so to quote Wayne's World..."It SUCKS as it CUTS!"  I LOVE IT!! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS TRIMMER!  I have never written a review for Amazon before and I've been shopping here for years! That's how fired up I am about my new purchase!!!!
serious I've been following these guys since their Tom Goes To The Mayor days.  I think they're both brilliant and obviously a host of celebrities the likes of John C. Reilly, Jeff Goldblum and Patten Oswald think so too.  I can understand though how some people wouldn't like it.  It's one of those love it or hate it shows.  Tom Goes To The Mayor was great but Awesome Show is on a whole new level.  I am hopelessly addicted.  I just heard it got picked up for another 3 seasons by Cartoon Network.  Thank you Lord!!!
serious I bought it and it worked right for some time. After a couple of hours, it starts making scratchy, distorted sounds in the background of the song really screwing the experience up. Some tracks just carry the noise throughout. This is a prob i've experienced with chinese MP3 CD players but this is a first on memory devices.  I have returned my Purchase and suggest that others try another model of SANSA or go for an ipod shuffle. Saves you the effort of buying, returning and/or following up on the refund.
serious This is a GREAT MAGAZINE for kids of all ages!! It has trivia for prizes, Video Game and Sports Gear Reviews by kids, a lot of differnt write ups on great Sports Stars like Tiger Woods, Lisa Leslie, Dale Earnardt Jr. and lots more that kids like! I'm starting my 2nd Year of the magazine! 5 STARS!! GREAT MAGAZINE!!
serious I can't believe its over :( Im not going to go into specifics of my interpretation of the show or why I liked or disliked the ending..I could ramble on all day about that, but for those who complain about all the answers not being revealed, I think we forget why we loved this show in the first place. So many of us stuck with this show for 6 years from day one, and will always hold a special place in our hearts ... It would have been impossible to end something like that with everyone satisfied. It may be "over" but I know at least for me, I'll be thinking about this show for a lifetime.
serious The Criterion Collection release of Armageddon is a treat.  It offers 2 commentary tracks, one featuring the director Michael Bay, actors Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.  Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has comments on several interesting things.  Affleck's commentary is sometimes very funny.  The other commentary track features the Director of Photography and special effects people. The commentary includes interesting details, including background information on the characters and filming locations.  Note:  The commentary is raw and sometimes laced with profanity, although the movie itself is rated PG-13, for reasons explained in the commentary.   Although it's not much, this collection is also a Director's Cut and has a couple scenes added, notable of which is Harry Stamper's character visiting his father before launch.  Some other scenes are cut slightly differently, adding some depth to the story. The Gag reel on the second disk is extremely funny, raw, and not your typical &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; documentary. The second disk also features a tremendous amount of information on the special effects and includes many different trailers and promo material.  The Aerosmith song video is also included. While the story can be nit-picked, it's still very exciting and enjoyable.  Overall, if you liked the movie, the Criterion Collection release is the DVD to have.
serious I'm quite pleased with the size, and sound of this little charger/player.  It will work great in our small RV and not take up tons of space.  I especially like that it is small and it charges my Nano as well as plays it.  The sound is not your big bold booming stereo sound, but not bad for a little set of speakers.  Will work for me and what I'm needing it for, and  I'm ordering 2 more for my grandsons' Nanos as well.
serious If you are looking for a lotion that won't leave your face feeling greasy, then look no further. It is THE best out there.
serious There is honestly no question that when it does come down to the best in quality printer, HP has really delivered the highest quality in ink cartridges, for their printers. That is proof with the number 60 cartridges. These are actually great and simple to install in my new deskjet printer. They deliver more ink that keeps them going well with each and every time I have to print up a project on paper. Whether it is writing up a resume, or printing coupons you need off the internet for all your shopping needs, they absolutely do the trick well. Anyone who owns a HP Printer knows what they get well in the quality of ink, and that is proof with the #60 cartridges. I absolutely recommend the 2 pack of black and color cartridges as a must have for anyone who has a heavy duty printer.  Price: B+  Convience: B+  Overall: B+
serious Filled with many well produced exaggerations designed to make a point and not necessary the truth of the situation.  While healthcare needs reform in the US, pointing to healthcare systems in other countries where their citizens come to the US for care if they can afford the cost is ridiculous.  Anyone that's followed Michael Moore's work has learned to expect a certain amount of exaggeration in his films, but Sicko sets a new high bar for him.  Net-Net: entertaining fiction presented as truth.
serious It worked for me on skin tags. I just followed the directions, it took one off right away, the other one took two applications.
serious I just bought this 1 month ago, and there are clearly more perks than I am currently taking advantage of. Here are the ones I'm already loving. It's a color printer that allows  pure black and white printing. (My old ones only did grayscale wasting lots of colored ink. I can print 6 slides per page, and all printing can be double sided, even multiple pages per side! Amazing paper saving options. Also, a very helpful automatic on-screen error guide. This is just the beginning of what this printer has to offer. To me, it is worth much more than its price!
serious Ever since getting the iPod Touch, I've had an extreme case of iPhone envy; the Touch's intuitive interface, sleek design, and overall pleasant experience made me wish I could use it on the go, and not be tied down to Wi-Fi networks. As a happy Verizon customer, however, I was not going to switch providers just to get a new phone (although the thought crossed my mind more than once!). After a long wait, I finally got my hands on an iPhone competitor, the Motorola Droid. While it might not be the "iPhone Killer" that people have claimed it to be, it's a great phone in its own right.  CALL QUALITY For some reason, I get fewer service bars/seemingly weaker reception compared to my LG Dare. In the same spot, holding both phones, I get 5 bars on my Dare (which I've since given ), while I only get 2 bars on my Droid. Weird, but fortunately I haven't actually noticed any decline in call quality or reliability; it's been superb!  SPEAKER Loud, and good quality! This is important, because whether you're listening for driving directions using the built-in GPS, streaming music through Pandora, or talking, the speaker is very loud and clear.  BATTERY LIFE Decent. Yes, the battery can run out quickly, but that's just because you'll find yourself using the phone so much! Some of the biggest battery drainers I've noticed have been screen brightness, GPS, and streaming radio. These problems can be resolved by turning down screen brightness (even at its lowest setting, still bright and crisp), turning off the GPS when it's not in use (through the Power Control widget), and not relying exclusively on streaming radio for music (with the included 16GB card you can store plenty!)  DISPLAY Gorgeous, crisp, and very bright display that makes other phones pale in comparison. I love it, and highly recommend those considering this phone to take a look at one in their local Verizon store. Even at its darkest setting, its very good. The high-resolution display also allows for text to appear much more detailed and crisp, a plus for those with glasses.  CAMERA The Droid packs a 5 Megapixel camera, as well as video-recording at roughly DVD-quality. The camera is a bit slow to auto-focus, but pictures come out fine. Not great, but decent for a cell phone, especially at night using the flash. While its still pictures don't come out great, the Droid's videos come out really well. The audio recorded on videos is also really good.  LOOK AND FEEL The phone isn't light, but it also isn't as heavy as I feared based on initial reviews. The only criticism is that there are no dedicated call/end buttons...instead, you have to rely on the phone application, which means you can't feel around for the call/end buttons, say you get a phone call in the middle of the night. Still, that's just a minor gripe. The phone feels sturdy, not cheap, and is pretty slim considering it packs a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard.  KEYBOARD One of the major selling points of this phone was that it has a physical keyboard. The keyboard isn't perfect - keys are shallow, too close to one another, and there isn't a dedicated row for numbers. Also, the top row of keys is inconveniently located too high to the top of the phone. Still, despite these shortcomings, I would not use this phone without the physical keyboard. After a year with the touchscreen-only LG Dare, I still had difficulty with typing, and even after 2 years with an iPod Touch - which has a much better touchscreen keyboard than the Dare - I have difficulty with typing on that, as well. While the touchscreen keyboard on the Droid is very good, I still make many fewer mistakes with the physical keyboard than with the touchscreen one. While I'd say this is largely a matter of personal preference, I'd like to emphasize that the physical keyboard isn't nearly as bad as some reviewers online made it out to be.  Android Market As it stands now, the Android Market has over 10,000 apps, while the Apple App store has over 100,000. As a result, some reviewers have said - wrongly, I believe - that the Droid is somehow more limited. One should remember that while the iPhone/Touch had a headstart in developing its application market, many new developers have flocked to Android as more phones have come to market. There already is a strong selection of apps, and this will only grow over time.  SHORTCOMINGS The two major shortcomings of this phone - especially when compared to the iPhone - are that: 1. Not as intuitive as the iPhone. I think this phone is great for many users, but others might find it to be a little complicated. This phone is very capable, but sometimes to find things you have to dig around a bit more than might be convenient (I don't mind this too much). 2. No widespread and easily available alternative to iTunes. I use DoubleTwist, but without a doubt iTunes is a much easier way to transfer media to the phone than dragging and dropping or using iTunes alternatives, for most people at least. While I don't buy MP3s online, others have also pointed to the iTunes store offering much more selection than Amazon's MP3 store.  CONCLUSIONS Who should get this phone? If this is your first smartphone, you might find things to be a little difficult at first, but well worth the patience. While this phone isn't for everybody, if you are already on/hope to switch to Verizon, this is without a doubt one of the strongest offerings. I don't know if I would necessarily dump my iPhone if I were an AT&T Customer, but I think that this phone will be a very useful tool for many people who have considered an iPhone but wanted a physical keyboard, more customizability, or more Google integration. While there are a few shortcomings in design and media integration, I can now say I've found the cure to my iPhone envy!   **UPDATE 2.22.10**  I wanted to say that while I'm still very happy with my Droid, one problem has arisen. For some reason, text messages I compose are not always going through...after minutes of trying, the phone simply notifies me saying that the text message was not sent. I have no clue why this is happening, but must say it is a bit frustrating. Fortunately, it doesn't happen too often, but it has happened enough to notice. This has happened to text messages I've sent to people on different carriers, so I'm assuming the problem is from my end on not the recipients'. Either way, a small price to pay for an otherwise amazing phone.
serious I bought this CD soon after becoming engaged to my fiance (now husband) and immediently fell in love with I Do (Cherish You) and my husband liked it as well. We had it played at our wedding and it is still my favorite  song. Besides I Do, Because of You is a beautiful song. Wonderful singers,  they do a fantastic job!
serious At first, people think this is some kinda sex-toy from the future. It's not. It's a beard trimmer. And a pretty good one to boot. If you're like me, you use your beard trimmer when you don't have much time in the morning before you have to take off for work. If you trim with this thing quickly on the 'normal' trimming mode, it'll catch maybe 75% of your hair in the vaccuum. However, when you enter warp speed (turbo mode) this thing is insane. It's really loud and sounds like it might explode, but it works great. It catches roughly 90-95% of hair in the vacuum in turbo mode. It's quite easy to take apart to empty out the little hair-catch-all and clean trimmer attachments or swapping them out (comes with a fine-line trimmer). The height adjustment doesn't seem quite as pronounced as my older Norelco trimmer (meaning you can obviously tell when it clicks into place...this one not so much) but it works nonetheless. I'm happy with it and recommend it to all who read this. Just be sure to take a minute out of your abnormally busy day to read the instructions and precautions and maintenance tips to prolong the life of this thing. That's what they're there for, after all.
serious "Oh my God! He's so hot when he's wet!" was the first thing I heard from the squealing 13 year old girl seated next to me as this movie started in the theater, and yes, Percy Jackson (the son of Poseidon) was frequently wet throughout this movie.  I also heard other variations on this exclamation, ranging from "He's so hot when he sweats" to "He's even hot when he bleeds!" and although I agreed wholeheartedly with the young lady to my left, this movie has a lot more going for it than the fantastic eye candy that is Logan Lerman.  The movie is a great adventure filled with plenty of suspense and cleaver and funny dialogue.  It also includes one of my favorite scenes in a movie released within the last five years, which I will only describe with the words "Poker Face" so as not to spoil it for any new viewers.    Yes, there are a several over-the-top or wooden performances from a few of the adult actors (Pierce Brosnan, coming off as more of a creepy child molester than the Dumbledore-like figure of wisdom and guidance he hopes to be) but the young actors playing Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Luke were fantastic in their roles.    This movie was so much fun; I wound up seeing it 4 times in the theater with a friend of mine who also fell in love with it.  I had never read the books before, but I am grateful to this movie for inspiring me to read the Percy Jackson series, which is better quality than the film.  However, as far as entertainment value goes, you can't beat this movie. 
serious It is a tiny camcorder.  It will easily fit inside cargo, jacket or baggy pockets.  Of course with the extremely small size comes some limitations.  This camera is not going to have the same picture quality as professional HD camcorders. But that said it is a very nice camera for shooting standard definition home movies.  It has an excellent zoom. The battery and built in memory are going to give you about 3 1/2 hours of recording time.  As for all the people who are complaining about trying to edit the footage (that is because they are not using Macs.)  If you have an up to date Mac it is a breeze.      I have an Intel Mac.  I convert the footage with MPEG Streamclip (Which you can download for free at the Apple Web site.)  And then it works fine with Final Cut Pro 6.  I convert it to Quicktime and then choose the DV setting.  It works great.  It also works just fine without MPEG Streamclip if you are using iMovie 08'.    The whole process is quick and painless.  No going through the whole tape to log and capture the footage.  So If you are looking for a tiny SD camcorder that you can take anywhere and edit it with newer Intel Macs, this is a great choice.  I think you will enjoy this camera.
serious What a great stroller and seat. This stroller is high quality, so yes, there's a high price tag! But it's worth it. People are constantly complimenting my new stroller. It's a cutting edge stroller and the price tag shows it. I have a 2 month old and a 17m old... it's perfect for us! Thanks Baby Jogger for yet another great product!  Update: 2.5 months later- still LOVING my stroller! I have both seats, and the car seat adapter. Love, love, love it. It's the most expensive baby product we own and it should be- I use it the most. I wanted a stroller that would allow me to bust out of the house with two babies or just one baby if needed... this did it. I don't need two strollers anymore! By the way, our boys are huge and this stroller holds them well. Our 18 month old is 30 pounds and the 3 month old is 16 pounds... still trucks along like nothing!
serious It has been a while since I've encountered a horror novel of such magnitude and scope, but Justin Cronin's hefty tome "The Passage" seems poised to announce itself as the latest true "horror epic."  It's about time too!  Ambitious and thought-provoking, but filled with propulsive action and bloodshed, "The Passage" is the thinking person's genre thrill ride.  This massive book starts in the near future with a pretty unique combination of vampiric lore meshed with science gone awry.  But Cronin, while nailing these explosive first chapters, has much more up his sleeve.  The expansive (and sometimes it seems the story will never end) plot resets several times until we have followed the confrontations to their inevitable conclusion many generations later.          The comparisons to Stephen King's "The Stand" seem apt and, I believe, will be widespread.  And in case anyone has a passing interest on where I fall on "The Stand," I think it's the best book of its type that I've ever read.   Although the books are quite different in plotting and structure, thematically they share much.  From the veritable destruction of the world as we know it, to the efforts to rebuild some semblance of a new world order, to the ultimate confrontation between good an evil replete with the requisite supernatural underpinnings--both books challenge ordinary citizens to rise to extraordinary levels to champion the human cause.  In the right hands, these apocalyptic epics can be unforgettable--and I'll just say that Cronin's hands are quite capable.     Don't misunderstand the King reference, however, "The Passage" stands as its own unique portrait of a ravaged future.  It's just that there are so few horror novels that set out to accomplish so much in storytelling.  Cronin's novel is gutsy, challenging and filled with high level drama of the first order.  It's not breezy or light entertainment, however.  It's a serious reading commitment for those looking for their gore mixed with a lot of substance.  A real change-of-pace and a welcome new addition to the ranks of horror lore, "The Passage" has earned the title of "epic."        
serious There seems to be a lack of reviews online for the new Sony 560 and Panasonic 80 Blu-ray players. So I purchased both of these Blu-ray players from Amazon, mainly becuase I wanted to do a critical, side by side comparison of all features and the audio and video quality. It wasn't a professional test-based comparison, just flipping back and forth between these players and my Samsung BD-UP5000 Blu-ray/HD DVD player on my Sony 52" Bravia LCD and studying the image with a critical eye. (I got 3 copies of the Braveheart Blu-ray to do this). Here's what I discovered:  Video Quality: Pretty much a dead tie. Both players had rich, dark blacks. Video noise (smoothness) of the pictures was so close that I couldn't tell which I was watching most of the time. Sharpness was the same. Both pictures had good "3D pop". I wouldn't be surprised if both players used the same chipset. (By the way, the Samsung uses the Reon HQV chip, and while it looked a bit "smoother" by comparison, a tiny bit of the sharpness and detail shown on the Sony and Panasonic was missing on the Samsung. Also the Samsung has a very slight cyan cast to the blacks and the overall picture.)  Audio Quality: I think the Panasonic wins here, but only by a slim margin. Panasonic touts this player as a "high clarity audio" Blu-ray player and it does sound sweet through my Onkyo TS-SR805 receiver, on my Paradigm Monitor 11 speakers. Again, this conclusion is based only on the DolbyHD sountrack on the Braveheart Blu-ray. I'm going to do more serious listening, but I think the Panasonic will still prove better, audio-wise, with any source material.  Audio Formats: Both of these players will Bitstream or PCM output the new HD audio formats. This means that if your receiver doesn't decode them, the player will. Or vice-versa. Some people say pre-amps/receivers do a better job at decoding than BD players do, but I guess that depends on your gear. The Panasonic DMP-BD80 sure sounds good, and I couldn't hear a decoding difference between it or my receiver. With the Sony, I think the receiver may have sounded a touch better, but that might have been in my head.  Speed and Handling: No question about it, the Sony beats the Panasonic hands down. This new Panasonic is no faster than last year's model it replaced, the 55. Everything about the Panasonic is slow...load times, react times when buttons are pressed, or when skipping chapters. The Sony 560 is about the same as the PS3. Every cloud has a silver lining, and the Panasonic DOES give you time to make a cup of tea while your disc is loading!  Another little thing about the Panasonic that I don't like is the size (width) of the disc tray...it's the same size or a hair bigger than the disc itself (instead of being smaller like most players) so it's very hard to grab the disc. This sounds like a little niggle, but try it and see. It will drive you nuts every time you try to remove a disc...you'll end up dropping them back onto the tray if you're not extremely careful.  Remote Controls: They're about the same...both very flimsy and cheaply made. Put a gun to my head and I'll say the Panasonic's remote is a little heavier and has larger buttons that are a little better laid out. The Sony 560 is drawing fire for this because it doesn't have an eject/drawer open button on the remote. This is a silly complaint...correct me if I'm wrong, but you almost have to be standing in front of the player to put a disc in or take a disc out anyway, right?!?!?! So what's the big deal about having to press the "open" button on the player? Serious remote-picky people have a Harmony remote anyway.  Other Convenience Features: Neither of these players has Netflix built in, I guess that's a big deal now. Unless they can steam full-quality 1080P (without pauses, subject to my ISP speed) I could care less about that. The reason I have 3 Blu-ray players is because I care about quality and I'm not too cheap to buy Blu-ray movies! The Panasonic has the Amazon/VieraCast and YouTube feature though. Again, I have no desire to see a rough, low-quality mpeg video shot by an idiot on a cell phone on my high def TV! Both of these players are BD 2.0 (BD Live) capable, but only the Sony has Wi-Fi built in. That's a nice feature because you don't have to run a CAT-5 cable from your router to your Blu-ray player. I think the 560 is the first stand alone BD player to have this (the PS3 had it all along). The Panasonic has 7.1 channel analog (RCA) audio outputs, important to people that have older receivers without HDMI. The Sony 560 dropped this feature that used to be on last year's 550 model. Most people have newer, HDMI capable receivers, so I see why they did it. (Sony also did it to make their step-up model, the BDPS1000ES seem more attractive. (That player is $699 and is basically a 560 with a handful of extra features added, like a headphone jack). The Panasonic has an SD card slot on the front, good if you want to view your pictures on your TV, and a USB jack. The Sony features two USB jacks, one on the front and one on the back.  Build Quality: About the same, maybe the Sony wins here by a hair. Both are smallish players, not very deep. The Sony is about 8/10's of an inch taller.  Conclusion: Overall I like the Sony better. It's wireless connectivity is a great feature, and Sony has a great history (with the PS3) of keeping the firmware updated, and this makes it easier. The Panasonic is a nice player, and has slightly better sound, but I'm sticking with the Sony. Anyone wanna buy a slightly used Panasonic DMP-BD80?  (By the way...I had no audio problems whatsoever with the Sony, like some other reviewers had. The Sony has a lot of audio output settings, and I still think some of them had them set wrong. That, or their other gear couldn't handle the output from the 560. I'm seeing a bunch of posts online recently about different TV's and receivers not being compatible or being able to handle certain audio signals, especially bitstream...if your gear doing the decoding doesn't have the "oomph" or processing power to decode it, it will choke and puke!)
serious This album rocks!! Lindsay Lohan successfully makes the jump from film to music with this cool CD filled with club beats and hiphop/rock that makes you wanna dance!
serious Although it has 10 workable buttons which come in handy for some games, it has some major flaws. On some games, if you press Up on the gamepad you go Down, and when you press Down you'll go up. The directional pad is totally useless, games where you need to move the D-pad rapidly, forget about it!! The buttons in the back eventually get stuck. You can't use any other Gravis controller while this one is in use. And on top of all that, not even the uninstaller works right. When you goto uninstall the controller, it screws up your computers registry files. It was a nightmare just to get my computer working again. I'll never buy another Gravis gamepad again.
serious I'm actually somewhat of a fan of Rufus' work. However, this is one he should have left alone. His voice and stage presence are clearly not meant for classic showtune-ish songs about adult themes which require range, vibrato, nuance, and gosh, you pick a few. His interpretation is flat and lacking in, well, interpretation.   He's handsome and talented, no doubt. He should stick to what he does best.   The second star is for the orchestra, though they should have had more sense as well.
serious I got my Droid Incredible in the mail on Tuesday even though the release date is today (4/29). The phone is stunning...with all the simplicity you'd expect out of a new smartphone and all the fun you'd expect out of a Google phone.  Pros: Android OS and Sense Customizable Beautiful Screen Android Market 8MP camera (shoots well in low light don't let anyone tell you different) super fast processor 7 home screens that you can view by pinching.  You don't have to swipe through all 7.  Makes my friends jealous. the browser is smooth and fast. Auto aligns text when you zoom.  uses multi-touch to pinch and zoom. Smooth scrolling and fast, fast load times.  Cons hard to sync any e-mail other than a gmail account facebook app sucks, but i just made a bookmark to the full site, since the internet is super fast optical trackpad is glitchy but i only use it for the camera battery life...but Seidio is coming out with an extended battery so thats not going to be a problem soon  Bottom Line: Honestly, I have been waiting for a phone like this every since the iPhone.  I don't have AT&T and to be honest I just don't like Apple as a company.  They make cool stuff, but they rip their customers off.  This phone is an iPhone killer.  Compare them on all levels of performance, looks, functionality, customization, and speed and you'll find that the Droid Incredible is the same if not better.  Also, Verizon's coverage is fantastic, so don't be fooled by 4G.  I'm sure its great if you live somewhere where you get service.  EDIT: (4/30) This phone eats RAM like crazy.  I installed "Advanced Task Killer" but I was still down to only 42M after a few days.  I would suggest downloading either "Task Manager" or "TaskPanel" (I have Task Manager and my boyfriend has TaskPanel on his Moto Droid and both work quite well).  I also suggest restarting the phone every few days just like you would a real computer.  Other than that still no complaints   :)
serious Review updated: July 17, 2009  I don't know what to say...this is a great product!  I remember back in the '80s, we had this crude epilator with a curved rubber tube with tiny slits in it that would open up on the bottom and then close as the tube rotated.  Well, it didn't work worth a crap and it hurt like the devil when it did grab a hair.  So a couple decades later and there's finally a epilator that works the way you'd expect it to.  And the greatest thing is, is that it doesn't hurt in the long run.  It'll hurt a bit at the beginning, especially when you're doing thick patches of hair, but subsequent sessions it actually feels good.  Basically the density of the hairy area you're doing, the more it'll hurt.  Think about it...the more hairs you're pulling out at any given time, the more pain you feel...makes sense, right?  But when you're just going afetr a afew strays or the sporatic regrowth, you'll hardly feel it.  Anyway, here's the deal.  Hair grows in cycles.  Not all hair is above the surface at any given time.  So when you epilate and you think you're smooth, don't be suprised when you find new stubble a day or so later.  But don't worry, that's not hair you missed, that's NEW hair.  Because when you pull it out, it's just as long as the other hair that you pulled out before.  And how long is the hair under your skin?  You'd be amazed.  The pieces I measured were typically 5-6 mm long.  And hair typically grows 1 mm per 5-7 days.  So if you do the math, once your skin is totally epilated, (usually over the course of a week), expect the advertised 3-4 weeks of smooth skin.  And the thing is, is that if you epilate every month or so, over time, your hair will become finer and thinner.  You may even experience total hair loss if and when any given follicle gives up producting hair.  EDIT: I haven't found this to be true yet, but who knows...  The epilator drum or roller is very unique.  It contains 40 metal flaps (tweezers) that move against plastic edges which grabs and pulls out the hairs as the drum rotates away from your skin.  It really doesn't take much of a hair above the surface for the tweezers to work either.  That's probably one of the greatest thing about this epilator.  ie. you don't have to wait days for hair to grow to a certain length to epilate them.  You can do it with 24 hours or so.    This epilator comes with several different heads and attachements.  It comes with the epilator head with two snap-on attachements that supposedly alleviate the pain for new users.  I found out that the one with the rollers wasn't really necessary.  The advanced user head makes you use the epilator at a 90 degree angle from your skin.  It also helps keep the RPM at a high rate.  But it hinders fine placement in those hard to get areas.  At which point, it's just as well if you don't use an attachment and go with the bare drum.  The other head is a oscilating razor with foil grill as seen in many other razors of this sort these days.  However, being a Braum product, it works really well.  The razor also has a leading trimmer for those long hairs that won't go into the foil.  There's also an attachment that supposedly cuts long hair at the preferred length for optimal epilation.       The spotlight on the on/off switch is excellent.  It's one of those little LED bulbs that are used in those multi-LED flashlights, so it is pretty bright.  It is kind of necessary in non-flourescent lighting as I notice that if I go outside in sunlight I can see a bunch of hairs (stubble) that I didn't know I had.   Anyway, if you want the very best of modern epilators, get this one.  It'll save you tons of money in disposable razors and/or waxing.  It'll pay for itself in just one month.    EDIT: The new Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator  is supposedly more efficient, but it has mixed reviews.  Some say it's wonderful, but others say older models of different brands work better.
serious I purchased the Polaroid PoGo today and have done a fair bit of "playing" with this compact little printer over the past couple of hours. In fact, I have already used the first package of 10 sheets of Zink (Zero Ink) paper that come with the printer. So my first recommendation is; if you are planning on buying a PoGo, I highly recommend getting extra paper so you can get through your "testing" phase without having to purchase more paper. However, don't go crazy and buy too much, there are expiration dates on the paper which may affect your picture quality if you take to long to "expose" (print) them.  Connectivity: I have tested the Bluetooth capabilities with my Motorola Q, Laptop Computer (Bluetooth enabled), my desk-top Windows Vista computer (with Radio Shack "Bluespoon" Bluetooth 2.0 adaptor added) and my PictBridge capable Canon Powershot A 640 camera (directly connected to PoGo via USB cable) and the printer worked like a charm in all of the above tests!  Speed of Printing: Print time is about 1 minute per photo. There was no noticeable change in print speed with any of the tests I performed. Using the Bluetooth (wireless) connection or plugging in your USB cable directly from your camera did not seem to make any difference as to how fast the image printed.   Image Quality: Not great...but not the worst I have seen either...The pictures I printed from my camera (via USB connection) looked better than my pictures from my cell phone, but this was likely due to the higher megapixel image created by my camera versus the 1 megapixel image from my cell phone. However, the "white balance" of both my camera and cell phone images were a little "off". The whites were extremely white (almost washed-out) and the dark (shadow areas) were very dark. So if you stay away from printing bright "beach / snow" images or dark "night" photographs you will be OK. Photos with lots of color (flowers, for example) looked pretty good when printed with the PoGo.  Cool things to do: The adhesive on the back of the photo paper is a nice feature of this product. This makes it possible to add pictures to your hand written journals. You can stick them to business card magnets and put photos all over your refrigerator. You can make photo luggage tags, cards and much, much more.   If you don't need the highest quality image, but want to do some fun, creative stuff with photographs I would definitely recommend the PoGo. If you are a photographer hoping that the PoGo would give you a quick "proof" of what your printed images will look like, then this printer is probably not for you, since the image quality is not as good as you could get with some standard ink jet printers.   Have fun...  
serious &quot;The Sun also Rises&quot; made a huge impression on me when I read it as a college student a number of years ago.  It is true that one must look beyond the surface to get a clear understanding of any book by Hemingway.   It is also true that the language that he used was not flowery, nor overly  eloquent but the meaning revealed within the lines.  It is also true that  the characters are often expatriates; living on the fringe of society and  hedonistic to the max.  All of those elements are visible here, yet  sometimes it might require a magnifying glass to see it.  However, these  are the qualities which make Ernest Hemingway, the seminal writer for a  generation and certainly one of the best.      I propose one hint when  reading &quot;the Sun also Rises.&quot;  Pay close attention to the  relationship between Barnes and Robert Cohn.  Barnes laothes Cohn for being  everything that he is not.  What drives him over the edge (in the inner  sanctum of his own mind and demons) is the success Cohn has insofar as his  relationship with Lady Brett.  Barnes is impotent and this is a crushing  blow to his manhood.  The tragedy here is his inability to consummate a  sexual relationship with her.  It destroys him--yet he is still accepting  of his predicament.  This is what allows this character to maintain  &quot;grace under pressure&quot;-- as Hemingway once coined the  term or  the ability to stand or hold ones ground when all odds are against you.   Certainly this can be a tragic flaw for any of Hemingway's male  characters--the total loss of his virility.  Yet he stands his ground and  never loses it.  He just hates Cohn from a distance and rationalizes that  he (Cohn) is one who cannot do anything just for the sake of doing  it---whether it be drinking, winning the Princeton boxing title, or being  in love with Brett.  It is complicated but one can come away with these  qualities after finishing the novel rather than while reading it.      I  think his friend and sometimes rival, F. Scott Fitzgerald, summed him up  best when he said of Hemingway: &quot;He's the real thing.&quot;
serious This shirt is a top quality product, and the price charged is excellent.  We were totally pleased with the product and the seller.
serious Came quickly in the mail and cost plus shipping was still less then what they wanted at the store.  Emery pads work well, blades seem not as good but workable.
serious i'm an avid collector of yeti products and it's rare to come across such artifacts. i purchased this shirt at a different location near my hometown and it fits like a gem.
serious Well Despite all the reviews, I decided to order the Archos 5 160GB version. I was a little worried about what I would encounter, however there worries would soon transition from worried to eased.  The make of this device is very solid and it is a little big for the pocket, but it's manageable. This device would be significantly useful for people on the go as it allows you to bring a large amount of media with you all in a neat little tablet that can handle HD output (Given some videos are going to be laggy, but this is normal for most hand held devices as they do not have the rendering capabilities that of a computer does). However to deal with this, Archos is trying to maintain regular updates. Just recently they released 2 updates for the Archos 5. If you go to the main Archos site, which is at [...] you can look at the updates that have been released for the device. It turns out that with each update they are trying to clean up the HD output given the limitations of the hardware also they are working on another update which is called doughnut, which is version 1.6 android, I believe (which will hopefully include the android market!! :)). This device also has a TON of space.  With all this space it can have other uses as well. I, Personally, have a large collection of books and music, I used this device as a backup of all my files so that in the event that anything happens to my main machine, I will always have the files I prioritized. Another neat little thing that the Archos 5 can do is it can read PDFs and Office Files, which is nice if you ever have to edit your office files on the go.  With the amount of area that is displayed by the screen, it allows for a very nice and ease of reading. At times I can find myself reading a book on it and reading it with ease with the large screen, as well as the capabilities of the software to handle PDFs. One thing to be noted by this is the fact that due to the hardware constraint, it will have to load each page after you read about half of your current page and half of the next page in order to have it load the next page. This is done to save space and maintain its longevity due to its hardware constraints. However, the transitions is very fast, shouldn't be a pain, although a very minor annoyance. One thing I should note is that some people have claimed that some videos are not able to play, although I have yet to encounter this issue.  I feel that I got a huge bargain on this device. Given its updates and overall capabilities as not only an internet tablet but also its media playback along with its touchscreen capabilities (which is acceptable, in practicality -- Make sure that you configure the touchscreen when it seems to not be functioning properly) it almost feels like a steal. To sum up the review I'm going to make a list of pros and cons.  Pros  Large beautiful screen Touch Screen Variety of Media playback capabilities Made with Android OS (very stable) Can be used as a PDF Reader as well as do MORE Has GPS capabilities Lots of applications -- AppsLib (And much more will come when android market is finally released -- although there is a way to get market on it with a little trick-- but it does not include all the times that are in the CURRENT market, its a makeshift to get it to work AND Google applications be installed using this little trick, Google "Android Market on Archos 5 Internet Tablet") Lasts a good amount of time Easy to use  ------------------------  Cons  No android 2.0 (yet..?) Charging is somewhat slow (it will lose charge [when plugged in via DC-IN USB to MiniUSB] when transferring files to it, do it in chunks to deal with this issue, although you'll still lose battery life) Somewhat laggy Video playback (should be remedied somewhat with updates) Locks up sometimes (this was in the past, however with the new update they released I haven't seen it happen..yet?) LONG start up time (use standby)  I hope this review helps you guys decide on buying one :) 
serious Not only is this bag look and feel good, it has plenty of space for my 15" widescreen laptop, files/folders, back up drive, all accessories, and wireless mouse...even has a number of exterior pockets for phone, water bottle, etc. Bag has nice padding in the back along with heavy duty straps and a sturdy top handle. All for a decent price.
serious This 70 pg. book was originally published in 1956 in the journal Psychoanalysis as "Psychoanalytic Observations on Chess and Chess Masters".  As one can derive from this title, the author has attempted to present us with a deeper understanding of certain chess masters using psychoanalysis, and in the process comes up with some interesting but also peculiar (in my opinion, at least) insights. In particular, Fine discusses the following players: Staunton, Anderssen, Morphy, Steinetz, Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Euwe, and Botvinnik.  For someone not familiar with the personalities of these exceptional players, Fine's anecdotal accounts of their personalities and eccentricities is quite facinating.  What kind of made me leary was the general remarks that the author makes in regards to chess and chess players, and how in particular he seems to sexualize the purpose of chess.   For instance, on page 22 he states: "The profuse phallic symbolism of chess provides some fantasy gratification of the homosexual wish, particularly the desire for mutual masterbation.  This is, of course, completely repressed.  Checkmate may be seen as rendering the father impotent, again part of the homosexual complex."  Oh, really?  And here I thoight that chess was a game, to be played for fun and enjoyment, or in some cases competatively.  I can't quite remember ever feeling that it was the expression of a "desire for mutual masterbation"--well, how could I, because I can't, since I'm repressing it.  Well, that's just pure bunk, in my opinion.  Fortunately, this book isn't entirely like this, so it does have its merits, but it clearly isn't must-read chess literature.
serious Can't think of anything bad about it.  I use it everyday ripping 2x stock and building cabinets and furniture projects. Works good for dado operations, has an accurate fence and easy extendable table.  Saw has plenty of power for most operations.  The portability of this saw is great and easily stores away when not in use.
serious So cool that they're back! I'm going to get a red or black pair--hope they take off and they start making more colors and designs like the old days! Good to see Minnesota boys make it good...AGAIN(my Mom went to school with Dan Stock who co-created them).
serious First of all, full disclosure requires that I mention that I helped copy edit this book for the publisher. This means that I have a very thorough knowledge of the contents of the book.  This book is not for *everyone* who plays massively multi-player online (MMO) games, but is instead designed specifically for those who are--or are curious about becoming--leaders and officers of guilds, those organized groups that are the lifeblood of MMOs. The book covers a very wide gamut within this topic, but the main take-away is that this book is helpful for ANYONE interested in guild leadership. Those who are wondering what is involved in starting and leading a guild will find a lot of information about how to create a new guild from scratch, while those who are already officers or leaders will find a lot of helpful information for topics like how to deal with churn, personality conflicts, or drama.  The author includes numerous examples--many by way of personal experience--that make it easy for the reader to see how policies or situations may apply in a real in-game situation. Best of all, the author takes great care to ensure that this book is about the role of guild leadership in all MMOs; this is not a book about how to be a guild leader in any one specific game (that is, you won't feel left out that you are a guild leader in a smaller MMO instead of a behemoth like World of Warcraft).  The book is organized in a way that readers can easily go directly to a section and gather practical information, and in that way. Readers should get just as much out of this by picking a specific section to read, as if they sat down and read the book cover to cover.  I see this book as both a cookbook for guild leadership (that is, identifying and finding a particular topic that applies to your situation and looking up solutions), as well as a disaster prevention/management book for how to ensure that your guild runs smoothly.  All in all, this is a highly detailed and unique book that should be very helpful for both current guild leaders and officers, as well as those interested in what is involved in running a guild. If you're feeling generous, consider getting this for your guild leader.
serious Sam Wasson's just-released and delightful book on the making of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" is so chock-full of great anecdotes that you're sorry when it's over.  For awhile, you are there - a privileged insider-witness to a marvelous bygone moment in moviemaking history - and it's with a feeling of bittersweet regret that you step from its closing pages back into a realm of noisy 3D sequels and superfluous comic book franchises. Everything you'd want to know and more is delivered in the book, from the reader's coverage producer Marty Jurow was first handed, re: adapting Capote's book for the screen ("In any event this is more of a character sketch than a story. NOT RECOMMENDED") to the guest list for the post-premiere party (including such unlikely elbow-rubbers as Dennis Hopper, Buster Keaton, Charles Laughton, and Jane Mansfield).  A delicious through-line in the book is how close the movie came to not coming out so well as it did, with such jaw-droppers as everyone's resistance to having Henry Mancini write a song for the thing (eventual collaborator Johnny Mercer's original lyric, we learn, one of three eventually presented to Mancini, was called "Blue River").  An intimate exploration of the myriad personalities in conflict and collusion when a casual classic is being created, the book is cannily adept at detailing the logic of the so many minute decisions that lead to what we now accept as inevitable.  Of course Audrey Hepburn played Holly Golightly, you think, until you hear how hard Capote lobbied for Marilyn Monroe.  Wasson is a formidable researcher.  He doesn't so much know where the bodies are buried as he knows where the hearts and minds are hidden.  The book is written like a good novel, taking you inside the consciousness of its characters with an impressive, insight-laden believability ("Fifth Avenue"'s only recent movie-book rival in this regard is Mark Harris' fascinating "Pictures at a Revolution"). And Wasson's notes on how he arrived at, and can justify, his leaps of imagination and empathy are almost as interesting as the text itself.  Of course the book has its thesis and theories as well, positing "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and Hepburn's stylish, fresh, era-defining performance as a watershed moment in cultural history.  If you're a fan of Audrey Hepburn, the book is a must-have, because Wasson's astute take on what she was about, what she was up against, and how she delivered the goods strikes me as definitive.  Her spritely, near-angelic spirit comes alive in the pages of this eminently devour-able book, which is kind of an awesome dividend. 
serious Just opened up the box and I was impressed. The nailer and compressor both look like new. Plugged the thing in and slid in a sleeve of nails and started looking for something to test the nailer. Works awesome although my workbench now has a row of brads in it. I'll give the compressor a workout next weekend when I shingle my folks roof. Looking forward to it already.
serious Excellent movie!  Good character development, reasonable premise for the movie, and good acting. The main character's wife is a dedicated doctor who refuses to leave a patient in need and the son saving as many as possible when the worst is about to happen.  The Scottish character's comments about the question, "Can scotch be burned in the generator?" was great, "....are you mad?  That's 12 year old scotch!" and then pulls out a book to find 3 glasses hiding behind it.  As of the writing of this review, there is a class 4 hurricane bearing down on New Orleans, LA and Biloxi, MS.  The idea of massive storms correcting our global warming is feasible.  The inclusion of the frozen mastodon was a nice touch!  Most everyone knows of the stories of instantly frozen mastodons with flowers in their mouths and this movie provided vivid realism of how instant freezing can occur.  My 10 year old son and my mother watched this movie.  The realism and sheer terror of the possibilities went over my son's head.  But my 77 year old mother thought it was the best movie she had seen in years.    I must say, I agree with my mom for once! The Day After Tomorrow is the best movie I have seen in a long time!   
serious I love this pedometer! It is the most accurate pedometer that I have ever had. I tested it on my treadmill and when I walk. I have put it on my belt loop and also in my pants pocket and it works great! I like the feature at 12:00pm it resets itself back to zero. I would highly reccommend it, worth the money!
serious Pretty good sci-fi/action/horror/semi-comedy. Probably a must-have for sci-fi collectors and definitely a must-have for Natasha Henstridge fans. The best parts (and most humorous) are the scenes where Sil (Henstridge) is trying to figure out how to operate in Earthly society. I would have given the show five stars if a couple more such scenes were included in place of some of the slower and/or more predictable scenes in the latter half of the film.
serious As previously noted these movies are all great movies and the sound and picture quality on the dvd's themselves are outstanding. Great work! I would have given it five stars but the lack of extra's for the price I payed is out there. Where are the deleted scenes that were repeatedly mentioned? If Lucas and Speilberg refuse to do commentary then why aren't there cast commentaries? No outtakes reel! Granted the 2 hour documentary is very nice and I love seeing the trailers its just a set like this should have been loaded. Lets take for example the Back to the Future dvd's, yes there was that whole widescreen issue but the extra's on those dvd's had everything, 2 commentaries for each disk, documentaries, and deleted scenes, plus the price was resonable!  Like I said most of us will be happy with these dvd's for the most part, and for the proper 2:35 widescreen transfers but I felt Lucas could have included a lot more extra's than were included on this set. Marketing I suppose in a few years it will be rereleased again with all new features, but at the moment I think Indiana Jones is almost up there with Star Wars for the record amount of rereleases.
serious First off, This speaker is incredible for it's size. There is almost no distortion in sound when playing on MAX volume. It comes with a USB splitter, to charge and a 3.5mm plug so that you can connect multiple X Mini II's together. It also comes with a handy bag to store your X Mini II in. I had an Altec Lansing iM207 before this, and the X Mini II blew the iM207 away!!!. The size difference was one thing, and the sound quality was another. The iM207 also ran on 3 AAA batteries. There will also be distortion in the iM207 on full volume. The playtime with the batteries was terrible. I had to switch batteries every week, with only around 20minutes of playtime each day. For the X Mini II, it can play up to 8 hours. There are also LED indicators of when you need to charge again, and when it is fully charged.
serious This Korean film by director Kim Sung Soo is a visionary masterpiece that brings to mind "Braveheart" and "Gladiator."  It takes place in ancient China, where Korean missionaries are betrayed by the Chinese and are taken into the desert to die. The Mongol hordes annihilate the Chinese guards and leave the Koreans to their fate. While wandering, the Koreans discover the Mongols have kidnapped the Chinese princess, and decide to rescue her and take her to safety. This is easier said than done, for the Mongols fight back with all the ferocity in their blood.  Zhang Ziyi is the most known star in this film, but she is hardly the main character. There and great performances by Jung Woo Sung as a quiet loner and Ahn Sung Ki, the skilled archer who gives Legolas a run for his money.  The scenery filmed in China and parts of South Korea is grand, and the battle scenes are filmed with finesse and brutality. Limbs are hacked off, arrows puncture necks, and heads are severed. This film is somewhat gory, so be warned.  This film was the biggest budgeted Korean film in history at the time of its release, and it was a box office hit in South Korea. It is a wonder why this film was never released commercially in the States, when it is on par if not far superior, to the films made in Hollywood. The DVD has some great extras in the 2-Disc edition, and I highly recommend this film to fans of Braveheart, Gladiator, and other epic sagas.
serious Published in 1847, WUTHERING HEIGHTS was not well received by the reading public, many of whom condemned it as sordid, vulgar, and unnatural--and author Emily Bronte went to her grave in 1848 believing that her only novel was a failure.  It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily's sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership.  And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back.  Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature.  Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers.  It is not a pretty love story; rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness.  It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant.  And yet--it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written.  The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback.  After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family--which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights.  It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a "Gipsy" child who he named Heathcliff.  And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion: wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she.  But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station.  She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all.  WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to "get into;" the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting.  But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations.  Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other.  As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone: Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world--dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself.  Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond.  It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe.  Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once--and those who do like it will return to it again and again.  GFT, Amazon Reviewer
serious the ipod touch 3rd generation is definitely the best multi-functional music player in the market. I got the first gen. 16GB ipod touch when it first came out 2 years ago but I ran out of space but I decided to skip the 2nd gen. because ipods are expensive so I got the 32GB 3rd gen. when it came out. But if you already have the 2nd gen. ipod touch you should save yourself the money and wait for the 4th. when hopefully a camera and a built-in mic would be standard features because this is not such a major update besides a faster processor, new stock headphones, and lower prices.  However, this ONLY applies to the 32GB and 64GB versions as others have noted. The 3rd gen. 8GB version is exactly the same as the 2nd gen. except it is repackaged so even with the reduced price, the 8GB is an inferior deal.  The first thing I noticed was how much the price of the ipod touch has dropped since its debut. The 16GB was $399 when it first came out and now this 32GB is only $299 ($279 on amazon). This does makes sense because that is how the market works but this is a very good deal.  Obviously $300 is not money to be thrown around, but the ipod touch is well-rounded and offers many features other than just being a decent music player. I personally could not tell any difference in sound quality from my 1st gen. and my 3rd gen. touch, which is a major disappointment because the basic function of an ipod is a music player and improvements are always welcome if not necessary.   The 3rd gen. offers really shoddy and quiet internal speakers, which is better than nothing on the 1st gen. and the stock Apple headphones are just terrible.  Note that the 32GB and 64GB versions come with headphones that have a built-in mic and music player controls, but they are basically the same. So you should factor in the cost of buying new headphones.   Some respectable brands for headphones or earbuds are Klipsch, Shure and Bose. I personally use Bose overear headphones because the noise that they block off really makes a difference on the crowded subway. While looking for headphones keep in mind that like all things out there, price and quality (and warrenties) have a direct correlation. But really, the ipod touch sound quality is not bad at all as much as I bash it.  What makes me give 5 stars to this 3rd gen. ipod touch is the fact that its overall package is unmatched in the market today, even with the new Zune HD (the Zune has a much inferior internet browser and limited apps). I am not going to make a comparison between them because both music players attract different audiences, where ipod touch users prefer the apps and the interface while zune users find the Zune Marketplace to be much better than itunes (Marketplace prices for music are cheaper and are a better value especially for heavy downloaders). But for the casual music listener, both are the very similar in form, function, and price.  The 3rd gen. ipod touch has a terrific internet browser that is superior to the Blackberry, but its limitations are that it requires a wifi connection and it does not support adobe flash. I use it to jot down notes quickly, to view my documents on my subway to study, check my mail, look up something quickly on the internet, and obviously to listen to music. There is a plethora of apps that can be downloaded and many are free and quite useful like AIM and SportsTap, and Remote. Apple advertises the ipod touch for the games that it can play and you will not be disappointed if you want to play something on the go.  Th 3.5 inch screen is crisp and watching videos is a pleasure. And the ipod touch does look great with clean lines but if you don't want to get the backplate scratched, you must by a case. The screen itself on the other hand is very scratch-resistant.   I highly recommend the new 3rd generation ipod touch for those who are looking for something in this price range and want a balanced music player that can also play vidoes, surf the web, and play quick  games. In a way, people are also paying for the Apple brand, which is not a bad thing considering you can bring your ipod to the apple store to get it fixed, you can purchase many different accessories, and you can have special compatibility features with other apple products such as with macbooks if you already own one or your school/business uses them.
serious Bought this as a `cheer me up' present for my second cousin after we lost the baby. She LOVED IT!!!!
serious Wireless works great.  Sound is decent from the size of the speakers.  I did hook it up to larger front towers, and that makes it excellent!  Overall this is a great device to go along with your LG tv.  One point of note, if you have this, you do not need the wireless dongle that is sold separately for the tv.  All the same features are in this device, ie. Netflix,Pandora,Vudu,etc.. the only draw back without using the dongle is you have to have this turned on and the sound will need to come from it rather than the tv.  Not really a big deal as you would probably want it on anyway if streaming a movie or music.  It will also turn on and off automatically with the tv, as well as turning the tv on when it is turned on.  Great thinking on LG's part.  Make sure you update the firmware as the menus are very slow without it.  Actually come to think of it, that was automatic after finding the network.  LG did a great job combining all these features into a tiny package.  I'm an Audiophile and never thought I would accept the sound quality of such a device, but come to find out I do!  All of my other equipment is high end, and I can honestly say for the price/features this device has, it delivers.  Build quality is ok for what it is.  I would have liked it to have a little more heft and a powered subwoofer rather than passive, but again given what it can do it's a nice piece of equipment.  If you are looking for a nice compact solution with decent sound for a living room I would go for it.
serious Let me say, I LOVE the "Twilight" books.  Like, REALLY LOVE them.  I love to read, and I usually read the classics.  I'm a Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Bronte Sisters kind of girl.  My friend insisted for two years that I should read "Twilight", but I kept thinking, "Teen vampire romance?  Not my kind of book."  Finally, this 29-year-old mother of three was on a flight by myself with some time to read, so I bought "Twilight".  I absolutely DEVOURED it--I read one book a day until I had finished the entire saga in four days. Luckily, "Breaking Dawn" had just been released, so I didn't have to wait.  The "Twilight" books are my absolute FAVORITE guilty pleasure--I love the fluff, the cheesy dialogue, the LOVE--all of it.  For me, "New Moon" really needed to redeem all that was wrong with the "Twilight" movie.  After watching "Twilight" last year, I was SO disappointed.  Catherine Hardwicke had just taken our beloved series and turned it into a made-for-TV movie.  I laughed at all of the wrong places.  How Bella and Edward fell in love was completely rushed.  I could go on.  Melissa Rosenberg butchered the book and everything that made me obsessed with it.  Sure, "Twilight" was fun to watch because it was "Twilight", but the portrayal was so, so, so wrong on so many levels.  My favorite book had been reduced to lines like "spider monkey."  WELL, "NEW MOON" JUST MADE UP FOR EVERY CATHERINE-HARDWICKE WRONG!  FANS OF THE BOOK WILL ADORE THIS MOVIE.  Edward actually smiles!  The acting was SO much better, the visuals were stunning, and the dialogue was much, much improved over "Twilight".  I honestly didn't want it to end.  It stayed so true to the book we all love, and the little additions were perfect.  I really felt like I was watching Bella on screen--Kristen Stewart was spot on.  Every expression, every sad word was perfect.  AND THEY SAID, "I LOVE YOU," something that was blaringly absent in "Twilight".  Chris Weitz has made a stunning, gorgeous film that lovers of the book will adore!  **I secretly wish he could remake "Twilight".  This is what "Twilight" should have been!**  This closet Twilighter was pleased beyond belief.  It seems like most of the critics' negative reviews have problems with the plot, the story, etc.  Well, if you like the book and, therefore, like the plot and the story, you will love the film because Chris Weitz is true to the book beyond what I could have imagined or hoped for.  This movie felt like it was made for the fans, so I can understand that if you're not a fan of the series how it may feel like a laboured effort to watch "New Moon".  But if you love Bella and Edward **and even Jacob--Taylor Lautner was FANTASTIC in this!**, you will leave wanting more!  Chris Weitz for "Breaking Dawn"!
serious I would recommend these earrings to anyone. Yes, they are I3 clarity, which means that there are visible flaws. However, these diamonds go on your ear, not your hand, and for that reason I think that they make an excellent value for diamond earrings. The diamonds are sufficiently colorless, and I would definitely buy them again for myself or for a gift (although perhaps not for  someone who is very picky about diamonds).
serious There are two things I take very seriously in this life:  one is books, the other is coffee (not surprisingly, the often go together).  While the bulk of my reviews are children's books, I felt it necessary to go against type and review this coffee grinder. Most coffee experts as well as everyday, casual drinkers agree that the best tasting coffee is brewed with freshly ground beans.  Once beans are ground, they begin to oxidize, much like an opened bottle of wine.  Old preground coffee has a tendency to taste bitter, and with the proliferation of inexpensive grinders, more and more people are buying whole bean coffee to grind right before they brew. Of course, finding the RIGHT grinder for the price is the tough part.  Grinders exist in every form and size and expense bracket.  Quite a lot of round, domed grinders I've used have unsharpened blades on a mount that is too high to really grind beans fine enough for specialty coffee like espresso or Turkish.  The Krups has a few advantages over other grinders, namely these:   ** The blades are sharp and mounted low in the housing.  Maybe other manufactures are saving a few pennies by putting flat tongues of metal in their grinders, but they don't have the edge to pulverize beans like the Krups can.  ** The machine has a higher RPM than other machines.  This makes it easier to reduce grind times and with additional speed, can reduce whole beans to powder in less than a minute (I've had a Black n' Decker that couldn't grind beans for Turkish coffee if you held the button for half an hour). ** the housing is oval and the lid is flat.  I'm not an engineer or physicist, but I think the flat lid and oval shape allow the beans to fall back towards the blades for further grinding (again, my Black n' Decker allowed the beans to spin around the lid in a whirlpool pattern that was pretty to look at, but pointless for actually reducing the grounds to the small particles I wanted). **  it has a large capacity.  Do you like strong coffee??  Use more grounds, then!!  The box says that you can grind up to 20 cups of java at a time.  I don't know about the sorts of demitasses they must be using to gauge the volume of a &quot;cup&quot;, but I do know that this machine can grind up enough beans for a number of very stiff MUGS of coffee. In the disadvantages column, the only one I could site is that the housing cup is slanted down, I'm assuming for decorative purposes.  Hence, I'm forever spilling beans out of the lower side.  My new secret is to measure the beans out in the LID, first, then turn the whole thing upside down and put the housing into the lid.  Since I only use it to grind coffee (and while I drink my fair share, I don't have the thing running nonstop day and night), I can't speak with any aplomb about how sturdy a machine is or how long it lasts.  I once dropped one after a year and broke it, but it seemed nowhere near quitting, so I can't vouch for how long it would work under normal, non-butterfingered conditions.  My assumption is that anything with such a high RPM rate isn't intended to be kept running for long periods of time-- creates too much heat and friction-- so if you plan to grind coffee night and day, it's probably best that you spend the money on a professional model intended for cafes. All in all, a fine piece of workmanship and definitely worth the extra few dollars over many of the other, cheaper, more poorly-designed grinders on the market today.
serious For the price, you really shouldn't pass up this opportunity for such a fun instrument. They're just the right size for the hand, and inviting to use.
serious ALthough &quot;The Village&quot; did have wonderful cinematography and an underlying story of facing your fears for the ones you love, I expected it to be a horror movie. I was waiting for some sense of action or suspense in the movie and this did not happen once. This was the first movie that I almost fell asleep watching. I was ready for it to finish. I'm glad that I saw it on employee preview night. It just went on and on. Thats just IMHO though. If you liked &quot;Signs&quot; or any of the book to movie adaptations of Bronte, I recommend this movie.
serious I, too, did the research. I read the glowing reviews on this site and found other sources to be just as affectionate in their ratings. It's all based on personal experience, of course. Three days after I got this lemon, it died (as so did 165 of my songs). I called technical support and they said, "dude, you're screwed." Luckily, Amazon refunded the entire amount.  I noticed, but not pay much attention to, the reviews on this site that gumbled that their Sansas died after a few days or months. So, take a close look at those reviews. I went ahead and bought an Ipod and...as of now it has worked like a charm.
serious  In college I went through a phase where I read all the Sherlock Holmes stories. Once I got started reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, I didn't want to stop. It was sad when I read the last story.   Now years later it was fun to read them again. I enjoy the Sherlock Holmes short stories more than one of the novels. For me one of the most enjoyable parts of a Sherlock Holmes story is reading about what happened, and then reading how Sherlock Holmes solved the problem. A collection of short stories provides this experience many times.   This collection has many classics. It has the famous line "It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." (The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet.)   It is also interesting to see what life was like in England 100 years ago. They had the underground, but use carriages, there was lots of travel by train, and life in general was a bit rougher than today.   If you haven't read any Sherlock Holmes stories, this is a good place to start.  
serious Child slavery, mistreatment of the elderly, homoeroticism....business hugs! These topics may not inspire bouts of laughter, but they are something we haven't seen before. Pushing comedy boundaries again in their second season, Tim and Eric are even more disturbing this time around and even more creative in their second season.  If you enjoyed (or hated) Season 1 this one probably won't sway your opinion either way. Besides the amazing duo of T&E you get great guest stars such as Raine Wilson, Patton Oswalt, and the incomparable John C. Reilly. (as Dr. Steven Brule)  This, like T&E's previous show Tom Goes to the Mayor is guilty of polarizing comedy fans on the Adult Swim network block. It's perhaps too adult for some and is maybe too silly for others. It's a great watch if you enjoy absurd and unsettling humor, though.
serious I first bought these diapers for my daughter when she got her first bad diaper rash at about a month old.  It was one of those rashes that looked as though her skin had been set on fire and nothing seemed to be helping it.  I had tried everything and thought maybe these chlorine free diapers and wipes will do something for her.  To my amazement, her diaper rash went away within a day and a half of using the diapers and wipes from Seventh Generation.  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself!  I think that really speakes volumes about the danger of whatever chemicals being are put into the other diaper brands.  These are now the ONLY brand of diapers I will buy for my kids.
serious This is my first iPod Touch and I'm enjoying every minute of it.  I previously had a iPod Nano 3rd Gen, but broke it at the gym, actually I smashed it on one of the machines.  I was debating about getting a nano or an iTouch, but I'm glad I chose the Touch.  The bad, would be no camera, battery doesn't last that long, and you require a wireless connection for some of the features.  The good, would be the buit in Wi-Fi, the tons of free apps, the easy to use interface. I recommend the 32GB or 64GB over the 8GB, the 8GB is really a 2nd Gen, not that fast when it comes to games, I got the 32GB and I can see a difference.
serious "May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month," and so is Arundhati Roy's novel The God of Small Things. Imagine a cold piece of butter slowly melting in a frying pan, setting the scene for the cooking to come, and you  can see the way Roy's prose works. Words that are hot and brooding reel you  into an intricate web of family politics and social mores, evoking a  feeling similar to a written stream of consciencness.  	Roy writes in  layers, except that the layers are both added and taken off; I was reminded  of my childhood when I would eat wafer chocolates from the bottom and the  top, leaving the middle until last, because that was the best part. Roy  kindly dispells the, often torturous, anxiety of what happens in the end  early on in the book. The reader is told what happened before it happened,  what happened after it happened, and saves what happened for last. A format  that seemingly would put off a reader becomes its most appreciated quality.  	This book is for everyone; murder mystery, love story, epic saga all in  one. Even if you're not the romantic type, the social scrutiny of Indian  customs provides for interesting reading. However, if you're interested in  brain candy, forget it. There is too much to absorb. Emotion and intellect  are needed in order to understand the emotion and intellect that are  related. You could take in only what is superficially presented, as the  plot alone is worthwhile, but you would be missing so much. 	Rahel, a  dizygotic twin returns to the place of her childhood and subesequently a  place of unhappiness to see her brother, the other twin, after more than  twenty years of separation. Esta, the brother, has stopped talking, and  Rahel has stopped feeling. Their reunion allows for the remembrance and  grieving of their disasterous youths. They recall small things, seemingly  unimportant, yet vital to the reconstruction of their sense of inner peace.   	They are the same age as their mother when she died, thirty-one.  Their house is run down and the only relatives left from the monster in  their pasts are, in essence, only waiting to die. Entering their minds  through an omniscient voice, we are transported back and forth in time,  remembering small things, painting a big picture. We remember a cousin's  accidental death, and the death of another who served as a scapegoat. We  remember how fate can make the strangest families. We also remember Rahel  and Esta, and how they "broke the love laws. That lay down who should be  loved. And how. And how much." 	While the novel serves to shock the  reader from time to time, the pace is slow. Roy's style would be described  as somewhat verbose for the impatient, yet serves to parallel the way we  deal with emotions, hurt, and love in life.  Creating a paradox however,  this reader went back to re-absorb certain elements of beauty or truth, due  to a lack of time created by an impatience to find out what happens next. 	 Although usually overly critical of fiction, I would recommend this book  for anyone who likes to read intelligent literature. It gives the reader a  chance to realize how profound those small things really are.
serious I returned the Swing and Lock gates and got this one. I am not disappointed. It was worth the additional cost. It comes with its own tool, which fastens the pressure mounts securely. I did not need an extension, so I cannot comment on how sturdy it is using those.It is very easy  to open and close, and the gate swings in both directions. It was also easy to install. I have no complaints. I can't believe how many people report bad experienced using these on stairs. If you read the directions, it is NOT to be used on stairs. If your child gets hurt, you have nobody else to blame but yourself! This gate is NOT for everyone. The opening is only 18&quot; wide, so this would not be for a home with a wheelchair. Although it installs easily, I wouldn't suggest this one if you plan on moving it from doorway to doorway on a regular basis. It takes a few minutes, not something I'd want to do all day. But it is very easy to move, such as if you where having a party or needed to move furniture. This gate is well made, but I do have one concern about durability. It has a plastic pin that locks the swinging part into place. I wonder if someone who does not push the pedal enough and pushes the gate, probably an unfamiliar adult or older child, could break it. I haven't seen anything to that affect in other reviews, so maybe not. Still, I'd have prefered to see metal. Maybe that concern is unfounded, I guess we'll see. Buy this gate.
serious I listen to talk radio, watch tv news (not just FOX) and read presses (online and print). This was easy to understand for me, but this is not why it got a 5.  Why it got a 5 is that Bernard Goldberg took his book Bias and put it up to the next level, being specific and showing the devolution of the mainstream/drive-by media. Everything someone who was attentive to the campaign knew is put in a way that makes him/her feel like this is the first time learning about it. For those who do not know what media bias really is, do read this book...  I got an early copy of this book somehow, and I finished it in 2 days (which is NOT normal for me...)
serious There are some things to consider before buying this particular card or any other 32gb SDHC card on the market:    1. This is NOT an ideal card for a digital SLR like a D80, D90, Rebel XT, etc... That is because it is a class 4 device. The class of a SDHC cards has to do with how fast they read and write files, not how much storage they have. For a digital SLR, you should purchase a class 6 SDHC card most of the time. Class 6 cards will allow you to take 'bursts' of photos and not be limited by the card's capacity to write them. Also class 4 cards are slower reading data, meaning they will take longer to upload files to your computer. Upload speed is convenient, especially when loading large batches of files.    2. This card has far more storage than most people will need for their digital camera. Unless you like to keep all your photos on a SDHC card and never move them to your computer, or are a high volume photographer, there is very little need for more than about 8gb of storage space for most caeras. The possible exception to this is if you have a professional SLR that shoots files in the 16-20mb range--but if you do, you'll likely want a class 6 card anyway. If all you intend to use this card for is a digital camera, save yourself a lot of money and buy a PNY 8GB SDHC Card . If you're worried about running out of space on a vacation, buy a few of them. Otherwise you run the risk of having 'all your eggs in one basket.' If one card fails, you lose all your pictures instead of only a portion of them.   This card is fantastic for use in a video camcorder capable of writing to an SDHC card. (Check with the manual first to insure that a class 4 card will be fast enough first). It is also perfect as extra storage for an ultra portable computer or net book like the Asus EEE pc. Another great application would be as added storage to a personal media player or MP3 player equipped with a SDHC slot such as the Cowon D2 .   There are other good 32gb SDHC cards on the market, some at cheaper price points than the Kingston card. IMHO, brand matters very little with something like a SDHC card, since they all are made pretty much the same way. None of the brands currently offering them (Transcend, PNY, Kingston) have high fail rates with their other products, so I believe they are all pretty similar. What you decide to buy will depend on whether you trust a particular brand, or who has the lowest price. All of them will work equally well.
serious  M.A.S. Abdel Haleem's English translation of the Qur'an is the best that I have seen. Some of the other English translations available, use awkward forms and archaic words that are difficult and tedious for the modern reader. But Haleem's translation is easy to read, yet scholarly. His footnotes, chapter intro's, and the historical background preface, is highly informative to the western reader; who may not be familiar with the history of Islam.  My problem is not with the translation, it is with the book itself. For a supposedly holy book, the Qur'an is rife with errors. Take for example Chapter 20 (Ta Ha), where Pharaoh supposedly tells his magicians that for their betrayal to Moses, they'll be crucified. The Exodus took place around the 14th century B.C. however, crucifixion was not invented until the 6th century B.C. by the Persians. In chapter 58 (The Dispute) Allah permits lying, but he damns those who "knowingly" lie. Does that make any sense? The Quran also permits hitting women ch 4:34, lying (because Allah is a liar ch 3:54), Jihad (holy war against non-Muslims ch 3:168-175), and in no uncertain terms damns those who believe that Jesus is God (Christians) ch 4:170-173. The Qur'an is also very anti-Semitic.   The Qur'an does not even compare to the Bible in: reliability, historicity, complexity, beauty, or applicability. No, the Qur'an seems like a jumbled collection of chapters that are highly repetitive and lack any real sense of order or flow. The Allah of the Qur'an takes delight in damning the non-believers, and repeatedly states that those who "ascribe partners with God" (Christians and the Trinity for example), will be damned.  Don't believe me? I took notes throughout the entire book, noting the errors, contradictions, and hateful theology that are found in the Qur'an. I challenge others to do the same.  So people need to read the Qur'an before thinking that Islam and Christianity are compatible, because clearly they are not! The Jesus of the Qur'an is a prophet; the Jesus of the Bible is God, big difference people!! And it doesn't stop there! Haleem's translation is good, but the book that he translated is not!!!  
serious Fable II, the aptly-named sequel to Fable, hit the markets a while back. I didn't have a way to play it then, but I do now, so even if this review isn't terribly timely, I hope you'll find it helpful.  The game takes place in the world of Albion, a beautiful, lovely world somewhere between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. In that it quickly differentiates itself from most fantasy worlds.  You play the Hero. You don't get a name, but you can get titles (like Lionheart, Executioner or the NAMBLA-friendly, Chicken Chaser). You can be male or female, good or evil. You can marry the opposite sex or the same sex. You can customize your looks with new hair styles, tattoos, facial hair and hair dye. You get all sorts of different clothes to pick from, and get scars when you die. You also age.  In addition, you get a whole slew of skills. You can learn how to chop wood, for example. If that's not exciting enough, you can also tend bar! Blacksmithing, bounty hunting and a couple other jobs round things out.  If jobs aren't your thing, you can go on a whole series of quests, though not very many. During these quests, you can earn gold which you can use to buy all the usual stuff, plus real estate. Yes, if you want you can become the next Donald Trump! One of my friends has done this and basically owns every bit of property that can be owned.  This is an action RPG, which is different from regular RPGs in that you don't select options from a menu screen. No, instead you bash, smash and crush your enemies by repeated button-mashing. Think of the Zelda games. You have both melee weapons and ranged weapons as well as a series of spells, some of which can be lots of fun!  Along the way, you have a dog acting as your faithful companion. Allegedly he helps in fights, but not so you'd notice. What he mostly does is sniff out treasure, and that's a damn nice thing, given how well-hidden some of the treasure chests are.  Graphics wise, this is one of the most beautiful games on any system. Everything looks gorgeous, even the darker and more unpleasant spots.  If it seems like I'm focusing overly much on the non-story aspects of the game, it's cause the story, well, kind of falls short. It's the usual "fight against someone who killed your sister" kind of plot. Nothing memorable. It's also rather brief. There's nothing wrong with it, per se, but it's not very original.  Still, the joy is in the journey, and this is one of the best games of its kind out there. Highly recommended!
serious I don't care about the looks, I'm just a fan of the music... And I'm not 12 years old, mind you, and neither are many of the other people who found &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; likable -- many adults like Hanson, too. I  don't care how many CDs you have, and I don't care about your life story,  either. You've got to relize something about Hanson and &quot;Middle of  Nowhere&quot;. This was written/co-written and co-produced by the band  Hanson themselves, when Ike was 16, Tay was 14, and when Zac was 11. You  have got to be crazy not to think that these boys (yes, they are boys) are  talented. You have to admit it, even if you don't like their music. What's  more, they play their own instruments. Why don't you go bother BSB or *N  SYNC or something because, unlike the hard working Hanson bros., they don't  write their music, they don't write their lyrics, they don't play  instruments for their music, and their music isn't good anyway. But take  &quot;M.O.N.&quot;:  It's not my favorite, but I really like it a lot. The  songs were written from the band's personal expriences (&quot;With You In  Your Dreams&quot; and &quot;MMMBop&quot;- you just have to listen to the  words) and what teens really feel and think (&quot;Weird&quot;,  &quot;Thinking of You&quot;, ect., ect.). All *N SYNC ever sings about is  breaking up with some girl, still loving that girl, and wanting her back.  One theme. On one of Hanson's very mature songs, &quot;Weird&quot; (which  happens to be my favorite Hanson song), they sing about feeling left out  and wishing someone was there who understood them. I don't care how old you  are, everyone has felt that why or will feel that way or do feel that way.  &quot;Thinking of You&quot; is about a boy with a crush on some girl, but  can't be with her (I guess because he can't tell her how he feels about  her). Everyone feels like that. &quot;With You In Your Dreams&quot; was  written by Hanson alone for their dieing grandmother. I don't care what you  say, these boys DO have talent, even if you think this CD is bad or  good! My favorits: &quot;Weird&quot; (my most fave), &quot;MMMBop&quot;,  &quot;Madeline&quot;, &quot;Yearbook&quot;, and &quot;Look  at You,  Baby&quot;. I really don't like &quot;Thinking of You&quot; and  &quot;Lucy&quot;, but they're okay. The rest of the songs are really  good, too. They don't really sound like the Jackson 5, but some of  Hanson's songs have a 60's and 70's sound to them. Also, &quot;Weird&quot;,  &quot;Yearbook&quot;, &quot;I Will Come To You&quot;, and &quot;With You In  Your Dreams&quot; are very mature and are NOT (I repeat; NOT)  &quot;teeny-bopper&quot;!
serious This urn is beautiful and very well made. The etching is detailed and accurate with a smooth finish. The inside is a bit rough with a powdery substance (possible a residue) but does not affect the function. The lid screws with brass threading and is a very tight secure fit. I recommend it.
serious This was a surprisingly well written book.  The author takes a fairly unbiased perspective on Rush addressing the good and the bad. I appreciate that Rush gave the author access to so many people in his life, including his psychiatrist! The book moves along quickly not dwelling too long on any one topic.
serious  I found this book very interesting. I'm British, but I take an interest in American politics. In this book ex-FBI agent Gary Aldrich relays his impressions and experiences of the Clinton White House.  AS is obvious from some comments in reviews here, the fact that the book has the political arena as its background means some strong reactions will be stirred almost by default.   But I did not find Aldrich was trying to score political points. His is actually something of a matter of fact analysis of more nuts and bolts issues surrounding the functioning of the White House. And he obviously cares very much about the dignity, efficiency and security of the place. And indeed, through his work he is obviously very knowledgeable about it. Which was one reason I found the book interesting, because it allows a glimpse into some of the basic mechanics of the place at the centre of American politics.  But even though I guess political loyalties will be fired up, it is quite plain to me that the book transcends these, and is in fact about what endures in the system of government beyond them. And although some individuals might get hot under the collar because of political considerations, nevertheless I suggest persons of any political persuasion should really be able to see the issues run deeper.  As for the reliability of the book, surely, the obvious basic fact of the matter is that Aldrich is an eminently credible and authoritative source. His job was to dispassionately and meticulously assess character in the highest office in the land for the sake of the standing of that office. A job he evidently took pride in, took very seriously indeed, did well and was respected for. It's obvious to me the man had Public Servant written all over him. I suggest he has proven a faithful servant to his nation.  I do not sense political opprtumism in this book, but moral courage. Aldrich seems to me to be a decent guy who felt it wrong to just shut up. And in so doing he offers an affirmation of the existence of bedrock decency in law enforcement agencies, itself no small matter.  I can't imagine he took the decision to publish lightly. It seems there was something very wrong in the corridors of power and Aldrich felt duty bound to alert the country. No matter what actual political persuasion Aldrich himself may have, this book is not in itself about that, and I think it's only reasonable to recognise this in assessing it.   I think the book is actually well written, which is part of its effectiveness. But it's not the fancy writing of the novella, its that of the informed, matter-of-fact report. Aldrich cuts to the chase, and his style is fluid and concise, making it very easily readable.  I highly recommend it. It obviously raises specific concerns, but more than that I think it raises fundamental questions about the nature of government in the USA; questions, for instance, pertaining to distinctions between process and personality, important issues when considering the mechanics of democracy.
serious "Anne of Avonlea" is a brilliant companion to the original "Anne of Green Gables."  This sequel combines the next THREE novels in the series --- "Anne of Avonlea," "Anne of the Island," and "Anne of Windy Poplars."  Several characters are combined to make ONE specific character, but the story still remains very much Anne's story.  Now a little older, having taught at the public school in Avonlea for a while, Anne decides to try her hand at teaching at a private school in Kingsport --- a wealthy town mainly run by a particular set, the Pringles.  It's a new and daunting experience --- especially considering that she can't seem to win over the students or the school board --- but her stubbornnes won't allow her to give up, and she charges forward with her usual determination.  There are several new characters, but we still have appearances by the old ones.  We meet Morgan Harris, his intelligent daughter Emmeline, his mother and his sister, and of course we meet countless girls who go to Kingsport Ladies College.  But Rachel Lynde and Marilla Cuthbert are still around, Diana Barry remains a wonderful friend, and of course there is the wonderful Gilbert Blythe --- more in love with Anne than ever.  This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen, it fits perfectly with the original movie and does a decent job of remaining as faithful as possible to the books, in spite of everything that was altered.  I love this movie.  To this day, my family occasionally has "Anne Weekends," in which we watch "Anne of Green Gables" one night and "Anne of Avonlea" the next!
serious I have owned several GPS units, including models from Garmin and Navman. I upgraded to this model from the TomTom 140S. This model has twice the screen size. The screen is brighter, and the sound is louder and fuller. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Routing is excellent. The Points of Interest database is huge. Advanced lane guidance is very helpful. The large screen makes data input easier. Like all TomToms, you can configure it to your liking.   The only negative is that battery life is reduced because of the larger, brighter screen.
serious I had owned various phones in the past and Nokia is the best on any comparison, for the Features available on this phone, had Apple had all these features it will cost 10 times more, most people don't even know it has extra camera on the front for video Calls along  with the 3.2 MP on the back, Video is far better and there were no sluggish performance as far as I had used for more than a month, unlike iPhone this phone can run multiple applications at same time which is like multitasking in PC, so I can play music and browse websites at same time and switch to GPS , attend a call and type an SMS.. And it goes on...all at same time, iPhone cannot do more than one at a time, we get millions of free software, games, themes etc., unlike Apple App store, no need to pay more and more. Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price.  If you like Garmin for GPS, Garmin GPS software available for this phone and installing that will make it the best GPS (it comes with Nokia's map software too) and no data plan or internet required for GPS as maps are copied to memory. It comes with lot of add on and Its not too big like iPhone and not too small, exactly made for using with single hand and I had replaced the blackberry phone used for Office with this and configured my Office outlook exchange server along with Gmail, hotmail and yahoo, how cool is that.  It handles website just as a PC and there is no difference with any websites, I can login to bank accounts and do anything like PC, it has stereo speakers but the Nokia Headsets are far Superior in sound quality and build and it comes with built in Mic and buttons for music track change so we can play music and attend calls without touching phone.  And FM is there to use while driving and at the Gym, Google has lot of software available for this phone like latitude, docs etc. If you want free chat software Fring (www.fring.com) is available for free, it connects yahoo, hotmail, AOL, Gtalk and Skype users all in one place and we can even make voice calls to online users. It has the great sync software that syncs all your photos, videos, contacts, notes etc between phone and PC using Bluetooth, just switch on the PC and it does the sync automatically. We can import and export all contacts from outlook, Lotus notes etc.  And there is software to use the screen as a touch screen mouse for the PC like a wireless Bluetooth mouse and that's free too.  For brand conscious users like me, I want to buy a phone from a telecom company like Nokia than a computer (apple) or TV (Samsung) company, who were just trying phones as one of their business.  iPhone doesn't have many of these features and only selling because of marketing, if nokia did their part, this should beat any phone for sure, I don't want to lock with AT&T for lifetime with iPhone and pay $ monthly and pay for any applications and did I say its unlocked? What else you can expect from a phone?
serious These are the only insoles I've tried that have taken away the awful burning pain in my feet and relieved the tired aching muscles in my calves and thighs. I stand for eight hours a day working on the casino floor so these insoles have given me the freedom to walk and stand pain free through an entire shift. They provide great arch and heel support.  Thank you Spenco for making a great product!
serious I love the feel of this thing.  But yes, it is true that it wont callibrate well.  I took the first one back and replaced it thinking it was defective.  Unfortunately the next one was worse.  The direction pad pulls to the left.  You also have to download software from the Gravis site, and though this improves things somewhat, the D-PAD remains faulty.
serious I have a smaller PC compressor in the shop that is very LOUD, so expected this one to be as well, especially since some of the other reviews found it so. But it's not much louder than the two-stage oillube compressor it replaced. I needed something that could be moved in a pinch, something that could run off 110V 15A service I have in the garage, and something with enough capacity to run my air ratchets, cut off tools, etc. I bought this unit fully expecting to have to wait for it to catch up occasionally, but it's kept up just fine.  The only complaint I have with the unit is the difficulty of reaching the drain cock at the bottom of the tank. Next spring when it warms up I might replace that with an Ell and a ball valve. It also draws the full 15 amps, so plug it into a run that nothing else is pulling from.  Overall I'm very satisfied with this unit.
serious We use cloth diapers, but when we want to use a 'sposie, we love Seventh Generation.  He also has gotten bad diaper rashes from other 'sposie brands, but the Seventh Generation are as kind to his skin as his cloth dipes!  As he's gotten older, wet diapers bother him more, so I'm ordering some Seventh Generations to put on him for nighttime so that I can hopefully start getting more uninterrupted sleep (please, please, God, let this work).  They're definitely absorbent enough to last all night, even on the nights that he spends nursing every two hours.  They're also nice and trim - he's a slender guy, and it's  nice that we can find a good fit that isn't too bulky!  Do I wish they were as cheap as generic disposables?  Absolutely!  But, not to put too fine a point on it, I feel my suspicions about the safety of the products used to make those have been confirmed.  It never fails that after we use them, if we have to borrow a dipe at a playdate or similar situation, my son has a red, sunburn-like rash all over his bottom, which goes away with a little bit of salve and a switch back to Seventh Generations or cloth.  From now until potty training, I'm staying stocked up on the Seventh Generations.
serious Lambert seems to be throwback to the "bigger than life" rock popularized by Bowie and Freddie Mercury and he pulls off this sound with sophistication and aplomb. Showing a very good range, Lambert hits both the rockers and ballads with a nice balance of hubris and control.  The first three cuts hit hard, with up tempo beats and a surprisingly plaintive vocal on "Whattaya Want From Me" gives the listener a good indication of what Lambert can do. "Strut" then takes things into more stylized mode and Lambert shows a bit of the over the top quality so necessary to pull off this style of song. Throughout the CD he surprises with a variety of styles and contributors like Rivers Cuomo and Pink keep things interesting. He still needs to find his own true voice, many things owe a bit too much to those who came before, ("Soaked" definitely seems to channel Mercury a bit too closely and a few others smack of pastiche rather than homage.) but overall this is an impressive debut. 
serious I liked the biscuits alot. They worked very well and kept my baby entertained for a long time. They were a bit messy but not as bad as some others I have tried.
serious WE OWN ONE OF THESE FANS, WE BOUGHT IT FOR OUR SON WHICH IS A BIG FAN OF BASEBALL AND WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT IN THE 3 PLUS YEARS THAT WE  HAVE HAD IT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FAN COULD CAUSE DAMAGE IF IT IS NOT INSTALLED CORRECTLY. OTHER THAN THAT IT OPERATES AND IS A WELL MADE CEILING FAN. OF COURSE, ANY FAN YOU BUY, IF IT IS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS. THE CEILING FAN IS MADE BY HUNTER AND ALL OF THEIR CEILING FAN PRODUCTS HAVE A LIFETIME WARRANTY. ANYWAYS I JUST WANT TO LET IT BE KNOWN THAT IT IS A GREAT CEILING FAN.
serious I've had this attached to my key ring for a number of years.  I don't need it often but when I have it's been useful as long as I am very careful while handling it.  The knife is extremely sharp and because the key is pretty thin it can rotate easily in your fingers. It's not incredibly easy to close around a key ring with one hand, and does with a bit of a snap, so you need to make sure your fingers are well out of the way when you do.  The Phillips screwdriver on the end of one of the tines is helpful for things like tightening eyeglasses, but it is slightly offset from the opposing blade and I've nicked or jabbed myself with it more than once while it's in my pocket.  You're supposed to lock it at either 90 or 180 degrees when using it, but when you close it from 90 the keyring end easily grabs at your fingers.  This isn't a product for kids, and only should be used with extreme care.
serious One Tree Hill - The Complete Sixth Season is arguably the best season of this much-loved drama. Season 5 really caught my attention last year, I have to admit I never cared for this show when these characters were in high school, the storylines were over-the-top but now I enjoy the maturity. I have recently gone back and watched the previous seasons and I still don't care for all the hoopla - Season 6 is just brilliant so start here and work your way back. Sophia Bush's character Brooke Davis really got to shine this season, she took in Sam, a wise beyond her years teenage girl - fell in love with Peyton's ex Julian and made amends with her emotionally distant mother. The season finale seemed like a series finale but I heard the show will back next season. This prime time soap is a guilty pleasure and I am proud of it!
serious First of all, I believe that children are a blessing as the Bible states. One blessing is that it keeps parents from living a self-centred life (a sin) and helps them become more like Jesus. I also firmly believe that having more children than you can take care of/support is a sin as well. When looking at the various types of birth control there are some that prevent fertilization and others that prevent implantation of the fertilized egg in the womb. The majority of pills do the later. Birth control using methods that prevent the embryo from living further breaks the commandment of "Thou shalt not kill" and constitutes a sin. I would love to hear what others think about these statements.
serious So many of the reviews are more about the character's actions- I'd prefer to actually discuss the book.  My sister just started high school, she's 15 and she lent New Moon and the first book, Twilight to me.  Despite our age gap (I'm sixteen years older) I found them a very engaging and entertaining read.  I'm glad to share these with her and I'd suggest them to anyone who is staring at a younger, somewhat mysterious female relative wondering what to buy them for Christmas.  The pacing is good.  The book is a quick, satisfying read.  My feeling is that the author works through scenes rather than writing in a linear fashion- and the scenes are fairly cinematic in their structure which I personally like.  She gets to the point in her stories and fits a lot of action and significant detail in without overwhelming you with a density of vision.    If you're concerned about the content, as in "Is this appropriate to give my neice/cousin's kid etc" you can be assured that the romantic tension captured here is through restraint rather than exploration.  Not too surprizingly this is highly seductive.  Several reviews seem disappointed by the character's actions and have given fewer stars.  However, I'd like to say that this book is clearly part of a larger work and we're seeing Bella at a certain point in her personal growth.  It is not a conclusion novel so it doesn't feel like one.  She acts like, well, a confused person in love.  I think the depiction is honest and it is a good thing when a character can annoy or drive you crazy: it means you're engaged and the author has done their job well.  I'll be honest- I wasn't expecting to be drawn in, now I'm a bit annoyed I have to wait until next fall.    New Moon is the sequel to Twilight, so I'm covering both in my review.  I think it could stand alone but I'd stronly recommend reading Twilight first as it really gives the foundations and 'rules' of Bella's world.     
serious I am an Office Manager for a property management firm in Downtown Chicago.  I purchased this Panasonic microwave for the office because I own two other Panasonic microwaves at my personal properties and I am delighted with the brand.  This microwave not only looks nice and clean, but it stands up to use and abuse of the employees.  I also have not had any complaints that it doesn't heat food properly.  I would certainly recommend this microwave to anybody.
serious I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind.  First the good sides:  This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.  The not so good sides:  As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.  As a laptop replacement:  The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.  Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.  All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.  One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!  In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.
serious The ring is nice and heavy.  Have been wearing if for almost a month and still not a scratch!
serious Just bought it and have not used all the features yet. So far: sound/reception is very clear (which is what I wanted and what a phone should do). Battery life probably about 4 hours talk time, but too soon for me to be sure. Menu easy to use and can download manual from manufacturer's site. Transfer of media to PC and download very user friendly. Lots of features, though T-Mobile does not support some of them (make sure you check with your provider). The bad so far: not much memory, so you will need a memory card if planning to use the media features, whether video, music, or other. I haven't tested the quality of video and camera. Music speaker is great, considering it is only a phone. Summary: if you are looking for data/office/messaging primarily and the phone is your primary access to the web/e-mail, then this is not the best choice. This phone is a great option for those like me who are wanting an actual real phone with media (i.e. songs, radio, camera, video),internet and e-mail access, don't do tremendous amount of messaging, and everything else is a bonus. It also has a great task/organizer that is very easy to use. By the way, T-mobile has a very nice feature (web2go), which is a limited internet access, also for those who do not use the phone as a primary internet venue but want some internet capability. It is not available with most phones, where you have to buy the whole package (internet and messaging), but it is available with this phone, which makes it very affordable as you do not have to purchase the whole data package in addition to the phone. Also, the phone is just cool. Love when it lits up and the flip design is so much more convenient to hold than the sliders or data phones. Haven't used the radio yet. Hope this helps.
serious This is a great MP3/WMA player with one glaring deficiency: It insists on playing the songs in alphanumerical order by track title. The manual states this, customer support verified it and I couldn't find a reasonable work-around, so it went back. Sure you can manually move from one song to another as they play, but if you want to load an entire CD and listen to the songs in the order in which you're accustomed, it won't do it without interaction. In my opinion, this is a colossal design flaw. The original MuVo 64 and 128 will play the tracks in the order which you load them but not this one. If that won't bother you, the MuVo NX is the one to get.
serious So I am hugely overweight, and just had a baby. I thought that I would give this video a try, and I LOVE it. I am still on the level 1 work out, but am getting better every day. I can now do the whole 30 minute level 1 work out. Next week I am going to be adding level 2. In only 2 1/2 weeks I have lost 14 inches and 12 lbs. Now I still have 80 to go, but it is a good start. Bob does the level 1, and he keeps me motivated thru the whole work out. Right when I think I am about to die, he starts counting down, and tells me I can do it, and I believe him. Rather than sitting on my couch hoping the Biggest Loser comes and casts me, I decided that the more logical option would be to bring the biggest loser trainers to me. I would recommend this to everyone, from those who only have 10 lbs to lose to people like me who have 50+.
serious The revolution I refer to is the one that followed in the wake of the original publication of this book in 1961. Ellis formally introduced his REBT therapeutic model in 1955, but at the time, few knew and fewer cared. However, this book would change that forever. No longer would we have to settle for self-help pablum like "The Power of Positive Thinking", because now we had a piercing book for the masses that explained both clearly and thoroughly three things that no popular work had ever told us before. First, we don't just "get" upset, we "do" upset. Or, in other words, we make ourselves emotionally disturbed. Second, the authors plainly explain how we make ourselves upset. We create our own emotional disturbances mainly through our irrational (aka, unhealthy, self-defeating) thinking. And third, Ellis and Harper give us many effective techniques to combat these thinking patterns. The techniques suggested are divided into cognitive, emotive and behavioral categories, although in fact there is significant overlap for the simple reason, as the authors point out, that we don't just think or feel or behave in a vacuum. Rather, we are thinking/feeling/behaving beings, and this interplay, luckily enough, offers us many ways to a "profound philosophic change" in our outlook, which is the goal of this work. Easily, the most influential self-help book ever written and rightfully so!
serious There are at least two known breeds of Spotted Dick (or Spotted Dog, as it was once called).  The one that was a staple of my childhood (English working class) diet is a steamed suet pudding.  It is made from suet, flour, sugar, currants and raisins, and is usually served with treacle.  The Heinz canned version is a very different animal, a member of the sponge pudding race, containing no suet.  It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.  But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.  The genuine Spotted Dick (or Dog), described in O'Brian's books, is the glorious suet pudding of my youth. [PeterReeve] 
serious I have used for the past 6-7 months. For the most part it thickens and I have noticed regrowth in some areas. However these are on the crown and my receding hairline. The only thing is, it slightly grows so you can see very minor growth but nothing ever really comes from it. On the crown of my head I have had a bald spot and only in a very specific area did hair growth occur. Other then that I have noticed increase in thickness and growth in the places I already have hair. If you are in the very early stages of hair loss, I think it would be much more effective. However if you are quite away into it, may be better to look at some other options.
serious This product is fantastic!  If you're looking for a personal die cut system I wouldn't bother with anything else on the market right now.  It is compact when closed, so it won't take up unnecessary table space.  It is also very light and has a comfortable handle for travelling.  Yes, it is a bit of an investment, but it is honestly a better deal than many of the cheaper systems out there.  It can cut each shape in 11 sizes from 1 inch to 5.5 inches.  Most cartridges are around $90; compare that to quickutz & sizzix alphabets which retail for $150, can only cut one size, and take up a lot more storage space.  Blades are easy to replace and the cutting mats seem to last longer than cricut suggests.  You'll get more life out of them by rotating the mat each time you cut and also storing it with the plastic sheet to keep dust from accumulating on the sticky surf
