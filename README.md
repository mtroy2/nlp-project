To run this code:\n
Note: for all these files, if you want to change the train/test data, you must manually change it in the code - they accept no parameters
Naive-Bayes\n
  Unigram
    python nb.py
    If you would like to change the train / test files, you must manually go into the files and change the paths of each file
  Bigram
    python nb_bigrams.py
    Same case as unigram for changing train/test files
Logistic Regression
  Note: unigram naive-bayes takes approximately 35 minutes to run on a reduced size dataset
        Bigrams may take much longer - we have never run it all the way to completion
  Unigram
    python lr.py
  Bigram
    python lr_bigrams.py
Neural Network
KELSEY FILL IN PLS
