To run this code <br />
Note: for all these files, if you want to change the train/test data, you must manually change it in the code - they accept no parameters
Naive-Bayes<br />
  Unigram <br />
    python nb.py <br />
    If you would like to change the train / test files, you must manually go into the files and change the paths of each file <br />
  Bigram <br />
    python nb_bigrams.py <br />
    Same case as unigram for changing train/test files <br />
Logistic Regression <br />
  Note: unigram naive-bayes takes approximately 35 minutes to run on a reduced size dataset <br />
        Bigrams may take much longer - we have never run it all the way to completion
  Unigram <br />
    python lr.py <br />
  Bigram <br />
    python lr_bigrams.py <br />
